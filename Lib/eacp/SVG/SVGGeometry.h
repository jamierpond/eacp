// tile drawn that way came out at whatever number the percentage happened to

// Untransformed on purpose. The caller maps it afterwards, which for a stroke is
// the difference between a pen that scales with the drawing and one that does
// not: stroking here and transforming the region turns a round pen into the
// ellipse a non-uniform scale should make of it, where transforming first and
// stroking after would keep it stubbornly round.
