// The gradient a `fill="url(#id)"` names, placed in the space `transform` maps
// into. Empty when the id names nothing, names something that is not a gradient,
// or names one with no stops anywhere in its href chain -- in each of which the
// shape falls back to the colour beside the reference, which is what the format
// says.
//
// Two coordinate systems have to be got right here and both are quiet when they
// are not:
//
//  - gradientUnits="objectBoundingBox", the default and what most documents use
//    without saying so, puts the gradient in fractions of the shape's own
//    bounding box -- so one definition means something different for every
//    element it paints, and a box that is not square is a non-uniform scale.
//    userSpaceOnUse puts it in the document's units instead, where `viewport`
//    is what a percentage is a percentage of.
//  - gradientTransform applies inside that space, before the box maps it out;
//    `transform` is the element's own, the one its geometry was baked through.
//
// The composition is left as a matrix on the result rather than resolved into
// endpoints, because a linear gradient under a non-uniform scale has bands that
// no pair of endpoints describes.
//
// `objectBounds` is the geometry's own bounding box in the document's units.
