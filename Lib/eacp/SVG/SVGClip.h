    // two empty regions apart -- and they mean opposite things. A reference to
    // nothing, or to something that is not a clipPath, is ignored and the

    // nothing, and an element referencing one draws not at all.

// The region a `clip-path="url(#id)"` refers to, in the referencing element's

//
// Empty when the id names nothing, names something that is not a <clipPath>, or
// names one with no geometry in it, and every one of those means the element is
// drawn unclipped rather than not drawn.
//
// Two things about a clipPath are worth saying, because they are what a document
// gets wrong quietly:
//
//  - clipPathUnits="objectBoundingBox" puts the region in fractions of the
//    referencing element's own bounding box, exactly as a gradient's default
//    units do, which is what `objectBounds` is for. The default is
//    userSpaceOnUse, where the numbers are the element's own coordinates and the
//    bounds are not read at all.
//  - clip-rule is the fill rule of the region, and it belongs to the children
//    rather than to the clipPath. A region built from more than one child is
//    non-zero whatever they said, that being the rule under which their union
//    is their union; a single child's own rule is honoured.
//
// `flatness` is the tolerance the curves are flattened to, in the same units the
// region comes out in, and `viewport` is what the percentages inside it are
// fractions of -- the one in force where the clip-path was written, the region
// belonging to the referencing element's space rather than to wherever in the
// tree the <clipPath> happens to sit.

// Worth asking of a clip, because a rectangular one needs no mask at all: it is
// a scissor rect, which costs the atlas nothing, nests exactly with every other
// rectangle in force, and cuts the glyphs a mask cannot reach. A viewport clip
// is the common case and it is always this.

// decides whether two elements naming one clipPath share a region: in user
// space they do, and a group's clip is one mask however many children it cuts;
// against a bounding box they cannot, each element's box being its own.
