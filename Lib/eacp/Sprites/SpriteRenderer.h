// 2D sprite renderer: textured quads and untextured primitives (drawn with a
// 1x1 white texture) share one always-blended pipeline per sampling
// configuration. Drawing happens in a logical space the shader maps to clip
// space. Every coordinate is a float, so callers keep full sub-pixel precision -
// smooth motion, high-DPI, fractional zoom - and snap only where they choose to.
//
// Draws are batched. A quad is queued onto a run rather than drawn on the spot,
// and the run becomes one instanced draw as soon as something makes the next
// quad unable to join it: a different texture or sampling, a scissor change, a
// video quad, or the end of the pass. Order is never rearranged, because with
// blending on, order *is* the picture - a run is always a contiguous span of the
// calls the caller made. A screen of text out of one font texture, or a floor
// out of one tile, therefore costs a single draw.
//
// None of which the caller has to know: begin(pass) joins the pass as a
// RenderPass::Participant, so whatever is still queued is drawn when the pass
// ends. Batching is an implementation detail rather than a protocol.
//
//     sprites.begin(pass);
//     sprites.fillRect(...);
//     sprites.drawTexture(...);
//     // pass ends; the queue goes with it
//
// A caller that changes pass state by hand - RenderPass::setScissorRect, a
// pipeline of its own - does still have to say when, since quads queued before
// the change would otherwise be drawn under it rather than under the state they
// were issued in. That is what flush() is for, and why the scissor wrappers
