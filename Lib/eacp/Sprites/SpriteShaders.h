// axis-aligned rects (perpendicular edges) and arbitrarily oriented quads such
// as thick lines.

// The quad itself is per-instance, so one draw covers as many of them as share a
// texture; only the screen size and the texture are uniforms. Its vertex and

// This lives with the sprite shader because it is the same parallelogram, the
// same tint and the same pipeline machinery — only the fragment colour is
// derived differently. Giving video its own renderer would duplicate all of

// frame is one quad per draw, so the quad stays in uniforms, where a batch of
