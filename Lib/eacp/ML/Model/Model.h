// The compile is cached under the cache directory as <hash>.mlmodelc, the
// hash taken over the program's bytes, the weights' identity and the OS
// build. A hit is loaded where it lies and never recompiled or replaced,
// because Core ML keys its engine cache on that directory: the first load onto
// the Neural Engine costs tens of milliseconds, a load of the same compiled
// model afterwards a few. A miss compiles into a temporary directory and
// renames it into place; one that loses that race to another process loads
// the winner's copy and deletes its own. A hit that fails to load twice is
// taken for damaged, moved out of the way and recompiled.

// of the model's own, in the order they were called, and resolve on the main
// thread; they are called from the main thread. One model runs one prediction
// at a time, whichever form asked for it. The model can be destroyed on any
// thread; that abandons every Async it handed out, and nothing they captured
// is called afterwards.
