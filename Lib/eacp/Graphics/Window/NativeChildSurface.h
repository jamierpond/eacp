// A rectangle in one of our layouts that somebody else's native view is
// parented into — the inverse of EmbeddedView.
//
// EmbeddedView puts a surface of ours inside a window another framework owns.
// This is the other direction: the layout is ours and the content is not. A
// plugin host is where that happens. A hosted plugin's editor is an NSView or
// an HWND the plugin built, owns and draws into itself, and all a host can do
// is give it a well-placed rectangle of its own window to live in and tell it
// how big that rectangle is.
//
// It is a View, so it is placed with setBounds, added with addSubview and
// follows its parent the way every other view does, and getLocalBounds is the
// size the foreign content has been given. What it adds is a native handle for
// the foreign toolkit to parent into, and the promise that whatever is behind
// that handle covers this view's bounds and goes on covering them.
//
// The foreign content's lifetime is never ours. Destroying the surface takes
// down the container and nothing else: content still attached to it must be
// detached first — a VST3 plugin is sent removed() — and after that the
// plugin's own view is the plugin's business.
