// The first child HWND eacp puts inside one of its own windows, and the one
// place it has to: a foreign toolkit is given an HWND to parent into or it is
// given nothing, and a View's handle is an IDCompositionVisual2.
//
// Which settles the z-order question before it is asked. DWM composites a
// child window over the parent's DirectComposition tree, so the foreign
// content draws above every eacp view in the same window whatever the View
// tree's own order says — WebView-Windows.cpp says as much where it explains
// why it renders into a visual instead ("impossible with a child HWND"). That
// is the right way round for what this is for, a hosted plugin's editor filling
// the rectangle a host gave it, and it is a real constraint on anything else:
// eacp content cannot be drawn over this surface, only around it. A host that
// needs an overlay has to hide the surface rather than cover it — and hiding is
// ShowWindow, not the visual tree, which is why visibilityChanged is hooked.
//
// The same goes for the mouse: the rectangle belongs to the child window and
// the View underneath it never sees a click, which is exactly what a hosted
// editor wants and is worth knowing before putting a widget behind one.
