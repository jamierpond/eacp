// A window's handleEvent hands the raw events straight here, because the
// window has nothing to add: unlike Wayland, where every surface is its own
// coordinate space, an X11 event that reached the toplevel is already in the
// toplevel's points, whether it was selected there or propagated up from a
// view's child window.

// Where the server has XInput 2.1 the pointer half of that arrives as XI2
// GenericEvents instead, routed straight here by the connection rather than
// through a window, and the core handlers below are what a server without it
// falls back to. The two never run together: a window selecting XI2 pointer
// events leaves the core pointer bits unselected.
