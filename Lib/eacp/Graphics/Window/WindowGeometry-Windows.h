// itself, kept apart from the HWND that feeds them so all of it can be checked
// without a display: where a point lands on a window's own resize band, how a
// window too big for its display is brought back within reach, and which
// pixels a rect measured in points covers.

// Grown to the smallest pixel rect containing the points, rather than rounded

// A window is asked for in points and opens in pixels, so a size that is
// comfortable on the display it was chosen on is routinely bigger than a 200%
// laptop's whole screen. What then hangs off the bottom right is the resize
// corner, which is also the way back — so the one window the user cannot fix
// by dragging is the one that most needs it.

// window can be dragged, WS_THICKFRAME or not. This measures out the band the
// frame would have reserved.

// diagonal grab is a target the user has to aim at.
