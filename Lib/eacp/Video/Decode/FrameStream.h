// the consumer; the consumer asks for the frame that belongs at a moment:
//
//     auto frame = stream.frameAt(myTime);
//
// which is what lets one object serve a media player (time from a playback
// clock), a game (time from the simulation, so pausing or slowing the world
// pauses or slows the video with it) and an editor (time from the timeline
// playhead). The frames themselves are ref-counted and outlive the queue, so a
// consumer can hold on to one, or composite several streams into one pass,
// without the decoder having to know.
//
// frameAt() only ever moves forwards through the queue: a playhead that jumps
// backwards needs seek() first, which Player::setPosition does for you.
