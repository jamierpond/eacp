// Apple still calls font smoothing is on: since Mojave that is no LCD fringe
// but the slight thickening of every stem the rest of the system's text is
// drawn with — a sixth more ink for dark text at 16px, a third for light,
// the fill's lightness deciding which — and without it text reads thin
// beside a native view. Which is why a mask is drawn in the lightness of the
// text it is for: see RasterRequest::lightText.
