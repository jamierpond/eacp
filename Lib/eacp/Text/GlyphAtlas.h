// Two textures, not one: masks go into an R8Unorm atlas (a quarter the memory

// A caller draws in two batches, one per texture, tinting the first and not the
// second.
//
// Growth over eviction: when the atlas fills it doubles, up to maxSize, and
// existing glyphs keep their coordinates — shelf placements only ever extend
// right and down, so nothing needs re-rasterizing. Only at maxSize does it
// clear, and generation() ticks so callers can notice.
//
// **One atlas holds many faces.** A face is a (family, pointSize) pair, and the
// key is (face, variant, font, glyph id, phase, lightness) — so a heading, a caption and a
// monospace log share one texture and are drawn in one batch. The alternative, an atlas per
// size, is what this class used to be: it costs a texture and a batch break per
// size, which is bearable for an interface that looks like one thing and wrong
// for a document, which mixes sizes by definition.
