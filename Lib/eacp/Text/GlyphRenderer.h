// Lives here rather than in each app because without it a GlyphAtlas cannot
// actually be drawn: two reasons, and both would otherwise be reimplemented
// identically by every consumer.
//
//  1. **Correctness.** The mask atlas is R8Unorm, which samples as
//     (coverage, 0, 0, 1) — the coverage is in red and the alpha is a
//     meaningless 1. Sprites::SpriteRenderer multiplies the sample by its tint,
//     so a mask drawn through it comes out opaque red rather than tinted text.
//     A glyph shader has to move coverage into the *alpha* channel instead:
//     `float4(colour.rgb, colour.a * coverage)`.
//
//  2. **Cost.** SpriteRenderer issues one draw call per quad, with a fresh
//     uniform upload and texture bind each time. A screenful of code is
//     thousands of glyphs; here it is one drawInstanced.
