// One glyph a layout placed: its pen in the caller's own points, and which
// glyph of which face to draw there.
//
// What a caller keeps when it wants the layout done once rather than once per
// frame. Laying a string out is a walk over its bytes with an atlas lookup per
// glyph, and a string that has not changed produces the same glyphs every time
// -- so a caller drawing an unchanged interface should be able to hold these and
// hand them straight back. See layoutInto and drawGlyph.
//
// It names the glyph rather than its texels because which bitmap it needs --
// the glyph rasterized at which of the positions within a pixel -- is only
// known once whatever the caller adds to the pen at draw time has been added
// and the pen is snapped; the atlas is asked then. Which also means a recorded
// layout survives the atlas being cleared underneath it.

// that pixel puts every texel on a device pixel of its own, which is what
// keeps text sharp -- a pixel-aligned bitmap drawn at a fractional position
// through a linear sampler is blurred by up to half a pixel each way, and a
// fractional baseline blurs a whole line at once.
