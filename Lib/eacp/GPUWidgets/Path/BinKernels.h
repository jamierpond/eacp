// Sorting a batch's segments into the tiles that walk them, on the GPU.
//
// A segment does not contribute only to the pixels it passes through: in this
// formulation it contributes the signed area to its right, so one anywhere to
// the left of a pixel adds its whole winding to it. Binning by overlap alone
// therefore loses everything to the right of the outline, and what carries it is
// the backdrop - see BackdropKernels.h. Both come out of the same clip, which is
// why the crossing is recorded here rather than in a stage of its own.
//
// The clip is per segment per tile row, not per bounding box. A long diagonal
// binned by its box lands in every tile of a square; clipped to each row it
// lands in the two or three per row it actually crosses, which is the difference
// between binning helping and binning being another way to do the same work.
//
//   clear  - one thread per cell and per tile, zeroing what the last frame left
//   count  - one thread per segment: the crossings, and a count per tile
//   sum    - PrefixSum, turning the counts into offsets and the counts into
//            cursors
//   fill   - the same threads again, writing each segment into each of its tiles
//
// **The count and the fill are one kernel, dispatched twice.** They have to
// agree exactly about which tiles a segment lands in - a fill that found one
// more tile than the count did would write past the end of that tile's run and
// into the next one's - and two kernels holding the same arithmetic are only
// equal until a shader compiler contracts a multiply-add in one of them and not
// the other. One kernel and a uniform mode is the only version of this that
// cannot drift, and the branch is uniform across the whole dispatch.
