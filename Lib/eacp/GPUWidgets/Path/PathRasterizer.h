// count reaches - and coverage accumulates *within* the path, so two of its own
// abutting parts meet with no seam between them. Abutting separate paths are

// Segments are binned into tiles so a thread walks the outline near its own
// pixel rather than the whole of it. What that costs is the sum over tiles of
// tile pixels times the segments crossing the tile, plus one backdrop lookup for
// every pixel that has no outline near it at all - getSegmentTests() reports the
// first term. A path is therefore priced by its outline rather than by its area,
// which is what lets one cover the window.
//
// **None of that happens here.** What this class does is flatten the path and
// transform it into the coverage texture's pixel space, which is `O(segments)`
// and nothing else. The clip that decides which tiles each segment lands in, the
// count per tile, the prefix sum over them and the counting sort that files the
// segments are four kernels - see BinKernels.h - and so is the backdrop, which
// falls out of the same clip. The only thing settled on this side is how much
// room to allocate, which is a bound taken per segment without clipping.
