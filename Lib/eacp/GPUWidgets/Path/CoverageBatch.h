// Every path a frame rasterizes, in one set of buffers and one run of
// dispatches.
//
// A rasterizer's own dispatch is priced by the path; a frame's is priced by the
// number of paths, and that is a different cost with a different answer. A canvas
// of a hundred and twenty-eight automation lanes was a hundred and twenty-eight
// dispatches and some five hundred buffer updates, one rasterizer at a time -
// each of which is a bind, a uniform upload and, on D3D12 outside a frame, a
// command list of its own. None of that is the rasterization.
//
// So the paths are concatenated instead: one segment buffer holding every path's
// flattened outline end to end, and a record per path saying where its cells and
// its tiles begin. Every stage finds a thread's path before it does anything else
// and then works exactly as it did.
//
// **The binning and the backdrop are built here, not uploaded.** What the CPU
// sends is the outline; what the GPU makes of it is the count per tile, the
// prefix sum over those counts, the sort of the segments into their tiles and the
// winding entering each tile column - see BinKernels.h and BackdropKernels.h.
// Those stages are per batch and not per path, so a frame pays for them once
// however many paths are in it, and a path drawn on its own is the only thing
// that ever pays all of them by itself.
//
//   batch.begin(atlas.getTexture());
//   for (auto* shape: dirtyShapes)

//
//   auto compute = frame.beginCompute();
//   batch.dispatch(compute);                     // upload once, then the stages
//
// The coverage stage hands threads out a **block** at a time rather than a pixel
// at a time - the 8x8 the 2D threadgroup already is - so a group's threads are
// one path's eight-by-eight corner, which is the locality the per-path dispatch
// had and the thing a flat pixel index would have thrown away. The grid is that
// many blocks laid out as a rectangle, which is also what keeps a big batch
// inside the 65,535 groups a dimension of a dispatch may have.
//
// Every path added must write into the texture the batch was begun with. Nothing
// else is required of them: sizes and fill rules are per path and stay that way.
