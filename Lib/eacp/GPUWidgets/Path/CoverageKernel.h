// It is the trapezoid arithmetic a scanline cell rasterizer (FreeType's, and
// every one since) does, evaluated per pixel instead of accumulated along a row.
// Working in pixel-local coordinates - where the thread's own pixel is the unit
// box - a segment crossing the box contributes the signed area to the right of
// it: the vertical extent it spans inside the box, times how much of the box lies
// to its right. Summed over a closed contour, that *is* the winding number where
// the edge misses the pixel entirely and the exact fractional area where it does
// not, which is why this antialiases without sampling anything.
//
// Exact, not approximate: see meanClampedX below for the one place where that
// costs anything, and for what sampling instead would get wrong.
//
// A thread walks only the segments of its own tile. The rest of the path reaches
// it as a single number - the winding entering the tile from the left, at the
// thread's own pixel row - so a pixel pays for the outline passing near it and
// not for the outline existing. See BinKernels.h, which sorts the segments into
// tiles, and BackdropKernels.h for where that number comes from. The CPU's part
// is the transform into pixel space and nothing else.

// Horizontal segments contribute nothing, and are dropped on the CPU rather than
// guarded against here.
