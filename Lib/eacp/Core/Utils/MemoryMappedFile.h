// as they are touched. Suits work that walks something large — decoding an
// image, hashing, scanning, serving byte ranges — where readFile would cost a
// copy of the whole file before the first byte can be looked at.
//
// Non-copyable (it owns a mapping); move it, or hold it behind a shared_ptr
// when a reader closure must outlive the call that made it.
//
// The saved copy is paid for with a live dependency on the file, and it is
// worth knowing which one you are taking on. The bytes stay the file's, so
// another process truncating it pulls the ground out from under pages already
// handed out: touching them then raises SIGBUS on POSIX, which portable code
// cannot catch. Windows does not have that hole — an open mapping makes the
// truncation itself fail — so this is a POSIX-only hazard, and one that only
// arises for files something else is free to shorten. Map what you control;
// read what you don't.
