// Called when something asks the app to quit on the user's behalf: Cmd+Q,

// false to refuse, leaving the app running — which is how a tray-resident
// app answers Cmd+Q with "hide the window" instead of "exit". Unset, every
// request quits, as it always has.
//
// quit() deliberately bypasses this and is the unconditional exit, so a
// tray menu's own "Quit" item must call quit() — a handler that refused
// everything would otherwise leave the app with no way out at all.
//
// A logout / restart / shutdown is never put to the handler either: that is
// the system asking, not the user asking this app, and refusing it cancels
// the logout with macOS naming this app as the culprit. Everything else is,
// Dock ▸ Quit and a scripted `quit` included — they arrive as the same
// Apple Event a logout does, and only the power-off notification that
// precedes a real one tells them apart.

// should call this from applicationShouldTerminate: and reply
// NSTerminateCancel, which is all eacp's own delegate does — replacing the
// delegate otherwise drops the app off the loop-unwinding teardown path and
// lets Cocoa exit() out from under run<T>().
