//
// Every pending callback shares one scheduler thread, so a rate limiter
// holding a deadline per bucket costs one thread rather than one per bucket
// (which is what Threads::delay, a detached sleeper per call, would cost).

void stopEventLoop();

// Marks the calling thread as this eacp copy's main/UI thread and brings up
// the services callAsync depends on, without running an event loop. For eacp
// statically linked into a dlopen-hosted plugin: the host owns the loop, so
// call this once on the host's UI thread (creating a Window or EmbeddedView
// does it implicitly) and the host's own pump then drives this copy's async
// callbacks and timers. Idempotent. A no-op on macOS, where the main run loop
// is a process singleton and callAsync already reaches the host's loop without
// any setup; on Linux the loop is per-copy, so this is what makes callAsync
// reach a pump — a foreign host drives it through
// getEventLoopFd()/pumpEventLoop() (EventLoop-Linux.h), and under an eacp
// host this is also where the copy hands that descriptor to the copy running
// the root loop.
void attachCurrentThreadAsMain();

// Stops the process's root run loop, provided an eacp copy is running it —
// any copy: loop ownership is marked in the process environment
// (EACP_ROOT_LOOP), which crosses DLL boundaries. The quit path for an app
// that lives in a dynamic library while a thin host executable pumps the
// loop (Apps::run<T> detects that case and rides the host's loop). A loop
// owned by a foreign host (a DAW) carries no marker, so this is a no-op
// there: that loop is never ours to stop.
//
// On Linux the marker carries the address of the root copy's bridge
// (EACP_ROOT_LOOP_BRIDGE), which is also how a hosted copy's loop
// descriptor joins the root copy's poll set — so an eacp host pumps a
// plugin's timers and callbacks without either side knowing the other.
void stopProcessRootLoop();

// True while a loop is running that work handed to callAsync will reach: this
// copy's root loop or a nested pump (runEventLoopFor), or another eacp copy's
// root loop — the EACP_ROOT_LOOP marker crosses images, so a plugin sees its
// host's loop.
//
// Ask before deferring anything that must actually run. During app teardown —
// Apps::run destroys the app once the loop has exited — this is false, and a
// callAsync there would sit in the queue forever (see Plugins::unload, which
// unmaps on the spot in that case instead of deferring into the void).
bool isEventLoopRunning();

// Schedules the app's one-time startup callback (the app/window creation that
// runEventLoop kicks off). Most platforms post it to the loop immediately; iOS
// defers it to UIScene connection so the window is created with a live scene
// after activation, not before. Platform-specific.
void scheduleStartup(const Callback& func);

// Pumps the event loop in short slices until `ready()` returns true or
// `timeout` elapses. Returns true if the predicate was met, false on
// timeout. Must be called on the main thread, and must not be re-entered
// from inside another event-loop callback.
