// The painter handed to Component::paint.
//
// An immediate-mode facade over a recording: a call resolves what it was asked
// for -- a colour, a gradient's row, a string's glyphs -- and appends it to a
// DrawList, and the frame replays the list into the batching renderers. A run of
// primitives goes out as one instanced draw when something forces a break, so a
// tree of a few hundred components normally costs a handful of draws rather than
// one per component, which is the whole reason the component tier is lightweight.
//
// Recorded rather than issued, because a component whose drawing has not changed
// should not be asked to draw it again: the list is kept, and paint() runs when
// the component says it has something new to say. See DrawList, and Component's
// repaint().
//
// Coordinates are logical points in the *calling component's* space, and that is
// what is recorded -- the list knows nothing about where its component sits, so
// one that moves replays what it has instead of painting again.
//
// Nothing here touches a render pass, which is what lets a component be painted
// with no frame in progress: a test can build a painter, paint into it and read
// the list back with no GPU at all.
//
// State -- colour, origin, clip -- is stacked via saveState/restoreState, or the
// RAII ScopedState below. Only translation is offered rather than a full affine
// transform, and deliberately: the clip is a GPU scissor rect, which cannot
// express a rotated region, so a rotating transform here would silently stop
// clipping rather than fail. Rotation belongs with a real clip stack, which is
// stencil work.
