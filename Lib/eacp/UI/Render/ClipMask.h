// stencil, a second pass or a render target. The clip's own coverage is
// rasterized into the same atlas by the same kernel, and the fragment reads it
// at the position it is being drawn at.
//
// It is renderer *state* and not a per-shape field, which is the trade to know
// about: a run of shapes under one clip costs nothing per shape and a change of
// clip costs a batch break, exactly as the scissor rect does. Set once per
// clipped group rather than once per shape.
//
// Note what it cannot do. Two of these do not intersect: a fragment reads one
// mask, so a clip inside a clip has to be composed into a single region before
// it arrives -- see Graphics::reduceClipToShape for what happens instead. And
// glyphs are drawn by a renderer that samples no atlas, so text is cut by the
// scissor rect and not by this.
