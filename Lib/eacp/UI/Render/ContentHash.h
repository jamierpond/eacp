// FNV-1a over whatever a cached thing is made of, which is how everything in
// this tier that is worth keeping is keyed: a gradient by its stops, a path by
// its points. Never by anything the caller supplies -- a key somebody types is a
// key somebody gets wrong, and two different things sharing one entry is a
// failure that looks like corruption rather than like a mistake.
//
// A key is a summary and not a proof, so every user of one compares the content
// as well before it treats a match as a match. That turns a collision into a
// comparison instead of into a wrong picture.
//
// Floats go in as their bit patterns, which is what makes a thing rebuilt by the
// same arithmetic key the same way. The one place bits and values disagree about
// equality is zero, and that one is folded, so a stop list carrying a negative
// zero keys as the list it compares equal to rather than taking a second entry
// for colours that are already there.
