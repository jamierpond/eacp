// is one buffer it owns and overwrites, so a second upload in a frame would land
// on geometry the first draw has not read yet, while the per-instance path
// streams through a pool that hands out a buffer nothing in flight is using. A
// batch has to be able to flush many times in one frame -- on every clip change
// and every time a masked shape is drawn between two meshed ones -- so the
// geometry goes down the path that allows it.

    // buffer the fragment stage would have to read, and the cheaper of those two

// costs the atlas the shape's own area on screen; a mesh is a few hundred
// triangles whatever size the shape is drawn at. Which is what a document of
// large stacked artwork needs, that being the case the atlas cannot hold -- see
// GPUWidgets::tessellateAntialiasedFill for the geometry and PathShape for the
// choice between the two.
//
// Ordering with ShapeBatch is the caller's business and cannot be dodged: two
// renderers queueing into one pass draw in flush order and not in call order, so
// whoever issues into both has to flush one before queueing into the other. That
// is what Graphics does, and the cost is one draw per alternation -- nothing at
// all for a document whose large shapes are all meshed, and a draw apiece for
// one that alternates.
//
// Joins the pass as a Participant, like every other batcher here, so whatever is
// still queued when the pass ends is drawn without a flush call to forget.
