// component draws (see DrawList), and this puts the lists on the GPU in tree
// order. It holds everything that is a property of the *frame* rather than of a
// component -- which renderer is queueing, what clip is actually on the pass,
// and where each list's own space sits in the surface -- so that a list can be
// recorded once, at the origin, and replayed wherever its component has moved
// to.
//
// Which is also why the batching lives here and not in the painter. A run of
// quads goes out as one instanced draw, and what breaks the run is a clip change
// or a switch between the queueing renderers -- shapes, meshes, images; both
// are decided by comparing one component's primitives against what the last
// one left on the pass, and only something walking the whole tree can do that.
