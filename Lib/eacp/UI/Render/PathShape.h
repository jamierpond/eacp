// compute pass can only be recorded *before* the render pass that samples what
// it wrote -- so it cannot happen inside paint(). Setting the path is therefore
// what schedules the work: call it from resized(), or when the value the shape
// depends on changes, and the host runs everything dirty at the top of the very
// next frame, before the pass that draws it. No latency, no stale frame, and
// the cost model is visible in the API - building a shape is a thing you do
// when the geometry changes, and drawing one is a quad.
