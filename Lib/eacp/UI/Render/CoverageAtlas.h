// One texture every path in the interface rasterizes into, so that drawing a
// path costs a quad rather than a texture bind and a batch break.
//
// The alternative - a coverage texture per path - is what makes vector shapes
// expensive in a batching renderer: each one is a different resource, so each
// one ends the run of quads before it. Here the kernel writes into a rect of
// this texture (PathRasterizer::setTarget), the shape carries the matching uv
// sub-rect, and a hundred paths go out in the same instanced draw as the
// hundred rounded rectangles around them.
//
// Texel (0, 0) is deliberately opaque, and the uv of it is what every *unmasked*
// shape samples. That is what keeps masked and unmasked shapes on one pipeline:
// the fragment stage always multiplies by the atlas, and for a plain rectangle
// it multiplies by one. It costs a fetch of a texel that is in the cache for the
// whole frame, against the batch break a second pipeline would cost.
//
// Allocation is a shelf: rows filled left to right, a new row started below the
// tallest so far. There is no free list, because there is nothing sensible to
// do with a hole a widget-sized mask leaves behind. Instead a shape keeps the
// slot it was given for as long as its mask still fits in it - which for a knob
// being dragged is always, since the arc only shrinks - and when the shelf does
// run out the atlas grows, or compacts if it is already as large as it goes.
//
// Either of those moves every slot already handed out, which hasMoved() reports
// so the caller can re-rasterize the lot. That is the expensive frame, and it is
// rare: the steady state is that nothing allocates at all.
//
// A move is only answerable while the caller can still start its walk again, so
// there is a pass on which it must not happen -- see setRelocationAllowed. On
// that pass an allocation that would move something is refused instead, and the
// refusals are counted, because an interface at the ceiling losing shapes with
// nothing said is the one failure here that is silent.
