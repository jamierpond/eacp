{
// Coverage already rasterized, keyed by the geometry that produced it, so that
// two components drawing the same shape hold one slot between them instead of
// two copies of the same texels. ComponentTree's channel strips draw one knob
// arc forty-eight times over; this is what makes that one arc.
//
// The key is the geometry and nothing the caller supplies -- see ContentHash --
// and a hit compares the stored path before it shares the slot, so a collision
// costs a comparison rather than drawing the wrong shape.
//
// What this is careful about is *mutation*, which is where sharing meets the
// thing PathShape already does: a shape keeps the slot it was given and
// rasterizes into it again whenever the new mask still fits, and that is what
// stops a knob being dragged consuming the atlas one frame at a time. Rewriting
// a slot somebody else is sampling would draw this shape's coverage through
// that shape's quad -- wrong, and silently so. Hence the rule:
//
//   a published slot may be rewritten by its publisher, and only while nobody
//   else has ever taken it.
//
// So `take` marks an entry shared for good, and `reclaim` succeeds only on an
// entry nobody took. A shape whose geometry churns reclaims its slot on the
// first change and stops publishing; a shape whose geometry is settled keeps
// its entry and everything drawing that shape shares it. The pathological case
// -- many identical shapes that all animate -- forfeits exactly one slot, once,
// rather than one per frame.
//
// Nothing is refcounted, because there would be nothing to do with the answer:
// the atlas is a shelf with no free list, so a slot given back is not a slot
// reclaimed. Entries therefore live until the whole cache is dropped, which is
// what has to happen anyway whenever the atlas relocates -- see clear(), and
// note that it and CoverageAtlas::forgetAllocations are the one pair that must
// be called together.
