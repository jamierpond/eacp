// Keyed by content and by nothing else: two images with the same pixels are one
// texture whatever buffers they arrived in, so an icon decoded in forty places
// costs the GPU one upload, and a caller has nothing to name and nothing to get
// wrong. The key is a hash of every pixel. That is what makes the sharing safe,
// and it is also what it costs -- see get().
//
// Where the tier's other caches keep what they hashed and compare it on a hit
// -- a gradient's stops, a path's points -- this one cannot: the pixels are the
// thing the texture exists to replace, and keeping them would double every
// picture in the tree. So a match is trusted on 64 bits over every pixel and
// both dimensions, and the picture that would be wrong is one where two
// different images on one screen hash alike -- which is not a collision
// anything will meet.
//
// The cache holds a reference to everything it made, so an image asked for
// again is found rather than uploaded again; the host drops whatever nothing
// else holds after each recording walk. A caller that wants a texture kept
// across that keeps the reference, and that is the whole of the ownership rule.
