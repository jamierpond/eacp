// A run of drawing rendered into a texture of its own, so it can be composited
// as one thing rather than a shape at a time.
//
// Which is the whole reason it exists, and the difference is only visible where
// the run overlaps itself. Fading twenty shapes by multiplying each one's alpha
// fades twenty shapes; fading the *group* draws them opaque into a texture and
// fades that, and every overlap inside it stays as solid as it was drawn. SVG
// calls the first a presentation attribute on each element and the second
// `opacity` on a group, spells them identically, and means quite different
// pictures.
//
// It is a member of the component that draws it, exactly as PathShape is, and
// for the same reason: the content has to be rendered into the texture *before*
// the frame's own pass opens, because a pass cannot begin inside another one. So
// the host walks the tree, runs every layer's onPaint into its own pass, and the
// tree's own paint() then draws the result as a quad.

// What it costs is a texture the size of its bounds in device pixels, a render
// pass of its own every time it is rebuilt, and one draw where it is composited.
// A layer whose content does not change is rendered once and drawn as a quad
// ever after -- setDirty is what asks for it again.
//
// **A layer may hold another layer, and the inner one has to exist first.** The
// host renders them in the order they registered, so a layer drawing another
// must be constructed after the one it draws. Building innermost-out is what a
// tree walk gives you anyway, and it is the only ordering rule here.
