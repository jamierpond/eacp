// One texture holding every gradient the interface draws, a row of colours
// apiece, so that a gradient-filled shape costs a fetch rather than a pipeline.
//
// The same argument CoverageAtlas makes about masks, made about colours. A
// gradient evaluated from its stops in the fragment stage would mean a loop over
// a stop list, a uniform block per gradient, and a batch break between two
// shapes filled differently. Baked into a row of 256 texels it is a texture read
// at a coordinate the fragment computes, so a document of fifty gradients draws
// in one instanced draw and the shader has no idea how many stops any of them
// had.
//
// A row is keyed by the colours in it, not by the shape that asked: two shapes
// with the same stops and different axes share one row, which is what a document
// repeating one gradient across an illustration does. Spread is not part of the
// key either -- the shader wraps the coordinate before it reads, so pad, reflect
// and repeat are the same row read three ways.
//
// Rows are written once and never rewritten, which is what makes it safe to
// upload in the middle of a pass: an upload cannot disturb a draw already
// recorded, because nothing a recorded draw reads is ever the thing being
// written. That is how the glyph atlas behaves too, and for the same reason.
