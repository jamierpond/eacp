//
// Never drawn over the box itself: CSS casts a shadow as though the box were
// opaque, so what shows through a translucent card is the page behind it and
// not its own shadow. Which is why the box is what is named here rather than
// the rectangle the shadow lands in -- the renderer needs both, and one of

// What one paint() produced: the primitives it issued, in the order it issued
// them, in the painting component's own points.
//
// Recorded rather than drawn, so that a component whose drawing has not changed
// is replayed instead of being asked again. That is the whole difference from
// what this tier used to do -- every paint() in the tree ran on every frame,
// because the only record of what a component drew was the frame it drew it
// into, and a frame is thrown away.
//
// What that buys is not the primitives, which are cheap; it is everything a
// paint() does *around* them. A string is laid out glyph by glyph, a gradient is
// resolved against the ramp table, a widget works out its own colours and
// positions. None of it changes while the component does not, and all of it used
// to happen sixty times a second.
//
// **Recorded in the component's own points**, which is what makes a move cheap:
// replay adds the component's origin as it goes, so a component that is dragged
// or scrolled replays the list it already has rather than painting again. The
// only things in here that are not local are the atlas coordinates -- a mask uv
// and a glyph's source rect -- and those move only when an atlas is rebuilt,
// which the host notices and answers by re-recording the tree.
//
// The parameters rather than the finished instances, deliberately: building a
// ShapeInstance is ShapeBatch's business, and a second copy of that arithmetic
// living here is a second place for the antialiasing margin and the corner
// clamp to be got wrong.
