// The third of the tier's queueing renderers, beside the shapes and the meshes,
// and the one Sprites::SpriteRenderer is the model for: a quad joins the open
// run while it samples the texture the run does, and anything else is a draw of
// its own with the run so far going out first. So a change of texture costs
// what a change of clip costs -- one draw -- and a row of icons out of one
// image is one draw however long the row.
//
// It reads the same clip the shapes do, out of the same atlas, so an image
// under a rounded clip is cut by the shape and not by its box. Sampled linear
// and through the mip chain: a picture drawn below its own size reads the level
// nearest that size rather than a scatter of texels, which is what stops a
// photo shimmering as the column holding it resizes.
//
// Ordering against the other two is the caller's business, exactly as it is
// between them: the queues go out in flush order, so whoever issues into more
// than one flushes the others first. DrawPlayer does, and counts it.
