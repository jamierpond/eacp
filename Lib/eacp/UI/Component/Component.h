// A lightweight UI element: bounds, children, paint, and mouse events.
//
// The deliberate difference from eacp::Graphics::View is that this is *not* a
// native object. A View is an NSView on macOS and a DirectComposition visual on
// Windows -- the right weight for a window's content, a web view or a GPU
// surface, and the wrong weight for a slider. A real interface has hundreds to
// thousands of elements, and one native view apiece would pay AppKit for
// layout, tracking and hit testing on every one, and would defeat the batching
// that makes drawing them cheap in the first place.
//
// So a whole tree of these lives inside a single ComponentHost, which is one
// GPUView, and is drawn in one pass. That is the same shape JUCE uses -- one
// peer per window, lightweight components inside it -- and it is what lets a
// component cost an allocation rather than a window-server object.
//
// Coordinates are logical points, and a component's bounds are relative to its
// parent. paint() is handed a Graphics already translated to this component's
// origin and clipped to its bounds, so a paint() body only ever thinks in
// getLocalBounds().
