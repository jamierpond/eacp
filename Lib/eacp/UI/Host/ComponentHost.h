// stale is painted into a DrawList of its own and every other one is stepped
// over, so paint() runs where repaint() was called and nowhere else. The second
// replays those lists into the batches in tree order. Nothing is submitted while
// nothing is dirty, and an animation costs the paint of the one component that
