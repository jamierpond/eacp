// A box showing one item out of a list, and the list itself while it is open.
//
// The list is not a window. A native popup is what a desktop toolkit reaches
// for, and it is the wrong shape here twice over: a component tree is one view,
// which may be a plugin editor embedded in somebody else's window, and a second
// native surface over it is a thing the host knows nothing about and does not
// move, scale or close with the editor. So the list is an ordinary component,
// added to the *root* of the tree rather than to the box -- a list is taller
// than the box that opens it, and every component paints through a Graphics
// already clipped to its own bounds, so a child of the box would be cut off at
// its edge.
//
// It covers the whole root, which is what makes a click anywhere outside the
// list dismiss it without a second mechanism for "clicked away", and it is
// clipped to the tree's own surface: a list opening near the bottom edge opens
// upward instead, since there is nowhere else for it to go.
