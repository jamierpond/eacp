// through the sprite renderer, then drawOverlay composites anything else — a
// scrub bar, subtitles, an editor's guides — in the same GPU pass.
//
// Two ways to drive it, and they are the two halves of the design:
//
//   attach(Player&)      the view runs the clock from the display link, which
//                        is what a media player wants.
//
//   attach(FrameStream&) the view draws whatever setTime() asks for, and the
//                        clock stays with the caller — a game's simulation
//                        time, an editor's playhead.
//
// The view owns neither; keep them alive while it is attached, or detach().
