// The process-wide picture of every online resource: where they go, what
// is on disk, what is being fetched and how far along it is, and what
// failed. Every OnlineResource reports here as it starts, finishes and
// removes, so a widget drawing this needs no handle to the object that
// owns a transfer - a view that fetched something and went away still
// leaves its outcome here. An app can also declare a resource before
// anything fetches it, so the same widget lists what it could fetch as
// well as what it has.
//
// The directory is the app's one place for resources: what
// OnlineResource::defaultDirectory() answers, where declare() puts an
// entry and what clear() empties. An OnlineResource told another directory
// still reports here, keyed by the path it lands at, and is simply not
// under the one clear() deletes.
//
// Every mutation and every listener call is on the main thread; entries()
// may be read from any thread and carries the live progress of a running
// transfer, read from the transfer's own atomics. State changes wake the
// listeners once per event-loop turn; progress does not, and a widget
// polls it with a timer while anything is fetching.
