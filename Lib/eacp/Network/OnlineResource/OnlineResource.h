{
// A file an app needs from the network, kept on disk and fetched at most
// once: a fetch finds the local copy, asks the server whether it changed
// when the server gave it something to ask with, and downloads only when it
// has to. Each successful download leaves a sidecar (<path>.resource.json)
// recording the URL, the version and the server's validators; a later fetch
// reads it back to decide. A .zip is unpacked and path() is the folder.
//
// Three ways in, from the most to the least hands-on:
//
//  * An OnlineResource object: start() returns an Async, and the object is
//    where cancel() and progress() live. For a view that draws a progress
//    bar and offers a cancel button.
//  * fetchAsync(Options): the object is owned for you and the callbacks in
//    Options are called on the main thread as it goes.
//  * fetch(Options): the same, blocking until the resource is on disk. For a
//    console app that needs the file before it does anything else.
//
// The transfer runs on a worker thread. It writes to <path>.part and renames
// into place only once whole, so an interrupted download never passes for a
// complete one. Destroying the object cancels a transfer in flight and
// abandons its Async, so no continuation runs into a view that is gone.
