// costs nothing in accuracy: every fp16 value, subnormals and infinities
// included, is exactly representable in fp32, so this widening is lossless by

//
// Emitted through a helper function rather than a bare call, because the two
// languages do not merely spell this differently - MSL bitcasts the word to a
// half2 and converts, HLSL calls f16tof32 twice against a shift - and a call
// node is one name and one argument list on both. See ShaderEmitter's
// helperDefinitions.
// Recorded against the graph directly rather than through detail::intrinsic,
// which takes float-vocabulary arguments only: UInt is deliberately outside it
// (see baseOf), and an index type is exactly what a packed word arrives as.

// The inverse: two floats narrowed to fp16 and packed into one word, .x in the

// half of a weight cache that stays packed on the GPU.
//
// A value fp16 holds exactly - anything that came from unpackHalf2, and so
// every round trip through a packed buffer - comes back bit-for-bit on both
// backends. A value it does not hold is where they part, and this is one of
// the two places in the EDSL that are not bit-identical across them (round()
// is the other):
//
//   Metal converts per IEEE - round to nearest even, and a finite magnitude
//   past 65504 becomes an infinity.
//   D3D specifies round-to-zero for a narrowing float conversion, and takes
//   such a magnitude to the largest finite half instead, explicitly not to an
//   infinity (D3D11.3 functional spec 3.2.2; f32tof16 follows those rules).
//
// So the two can differ by one ulp on an ordinary weight, and disagree
// outright about what a too-large one becomes. Neither is wrong and nothing
// here can reconcile them - the rounding belongs to the instruction. A kernel
// that needs a pinned answer rounds before it narrows.
//
// A helper for the same reason unpackHalf2 is one: MSL converts to a half2 and
// bitcasts the pair, HLSL narrows each component and shifts one into place.

// bits back in the top half of a word and nothing else - no exponent to rebias,
// no subnormal case, no rounding. That makes it exact and, unlike the fp16
// path, identical on every backend down to the instruction: the three dialects
// differ only in how they spell a bitcast.
//
// Which is why this may not go through fp16. bf16 has eight exponent bits and
// fp16 five, so 1e-6 and 1e30 are ordinary bf16 values that fp16 flushes to
// zero and to infinity. A checkpoint routed through half is not less precise,
// it is wrong.

//
// Unlike packHalf2 this *is* bit-identical across the backends, and that is the
// point of doing it by hand. The rounding is round-to-nearest-even written in
// integer arithmetic - add half an ulp plus the low bit of what survives, then
// shift - so no dialect's narrowing instruction is involved and none of their
// disagreements can reach it. A NaN is quieted rather than rounded, since
// carrying one into the exponent would land it on an infinity, which is a
// different answer rather than a coarser one.

//
// The sign extension is an exclusive-or and a subtraction rather than a cast or
// a pair of shifts, because that is the one spelling the three languages define
// identically: a byte read as unsigned is the signed value (b ^ 0x80) - 128,
// which is arithmetic entirely inside the range a uint holds and moves no bit
// into or out of a sign position. as_type<char4> would be Metal's answer and
// nothing else's, and shifting a byte up into the sign bit and
// arithmetically back leans on each language's own rule for what the sign bit
// does under a shift - three rules, spelled three ways, for a widening that has
// to be bit-identical.

// which is exactly the disagreement packHalf2 documents. An already-integral
// vector leaves nothing to disagree about, and a kernel that has floats rounds
// them itself, with round() or floor(), where the choice is visible.
//
// Only the low eight bits of each component are stored, so a value outside
