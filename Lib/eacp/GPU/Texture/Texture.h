    // accumulates over hundreds of them - a trail, a simulation state, a running
    // average - drifts to a flat colour it can no longer leave.

    // RGBA16Float is the one to reach for. Both backends can filter it on every
    // device eacp runs on, it holds well over the range a colour needs, and it
    // costs half of what the full float does. RGBA32Float is there for the

    // holding a *measurement* rather than a colour wants: a depth buffer copied
    // out for a later pass to read, a distance field, a height map, a single
    // accumulated scalar. Eight and sixteen bits are both too coarse for the
    // first of those - a window-space depth spends almost its whole range in
    // the last thousandth, where a half float has about one value to offer.

    // load.
    //
    // **eacp neither compresses nor decompresses.** These are for content that
    // arrived compressed - a .dds file, an atlas some tool produced - and the

    // encoding where the two endpoints are ordered the other way round, a
    // one-bit alpha - DXT1 with or without punch-through is this one format on
    // both APIs. BC2 (DXT3) and BC3 (DXT5) are 16 bytes and differ only in how
    // they spend the extra eight: four explicit bits of alpha per texel, or two
    // alpha endpoints and a three-bit index. BC7 is 16 and is the modern one -
    // eight modes, and near-lossless where the older three band visibly.
    //
    // No sRGB variants, because eacp has no sRGB formats at all.
    //
    // **What a compressed texture cannot be**, refused rather than
    // half-supported and in the same words on both backends: a renderTarget or
    // a computeWrite target, there being no per-texel address for a pass or a
    // kernel to write to. read() and update(region, ...) are no-ops on one - a
    // read-back would have to hand back blocks in a layout nothing here
    // consumes, and a region would have to be block-aligned, which nothing here
    // needs. And `mipmapped` gets it exactly one level: the CPU filter averages
    // texels, and a block is not four numbers to take a mean of.
    // TextureDescriptor::mipLevels is how a compressed texture gets a chain,
    // and is the only way it can.

// samplers: a descriptor table, which can vary per draw and would let the
// Texture carry its own state, or a static sampler baked into the root
// signature, which cannot. eacp used the descriptor table until a Windows-on-Arm
// driver turned out to ignore the table's offset outright and resolve every
// sampler to descriptor 0 of the heap - so every texture in the process sampled
// through whichever sampler happened to be first, and no per-texture state had
// any effect. Static samplers are unaffected, being nowhere near a heap.
//
// Since the configuration space is tiny, the root signature simply declares one
// static sampler per configuration - s0..s(samplingConfigurations - 1) - and
// the emitter points every texture at the one its declared sampling picks. Two
// textures sampled the same way share a sampler, which is exactly what a
// sampler is; the alternative, one per (slot, configuration) pair, was what
// this used to be and it made the sampler registers the thing that capped how
// many textures a shader could bind. Metal has no such bug, but declares a
// sampler per texture because MSL passes them as function arguments rather
// than binding them to registers.
//
// The cost is that the sampling is fixed when the shader is compiled rather
// than when a texture is bound: one shader samples one slot exactly one way.

    // On a cube this takes all six faces, in the order and layout the
    // descriptor's `cube` describes - the same block of pixels the texture was
    // created from. There is no way to replace one face, for the reason there
    // is no region form below.
    //
    // On a compressed texture, or one created with TextureDescriptor::mipLevels,
    // it takes the same block the constructor took - the blocks of every level,
    // tightly packed - and **bytesPerRow must be 0**. Both layouts are tightly
    // packed by definition, so a stride there is a number that can only be
    // wrong; a nonzero one is a no-op rather than an upload at a pitch nothing
    // means. A negative one is a no-op everywhere, on this call and the three
    // below: a stride is a byte count, and rows cannot be walked backwards.
    void update(const void* pixels, int bytesPerRow = 0);

    // Re-uploads one sub-rectangle, leaving the rest of the texture untouched.
    //
    // The reason this exists: a glyph atlas grows one glyph at a time, and
    // whole-texture update() makes each new glyph cost an upload of the entire
    // atlas — megabytes to move a few hundred bytes. Here the transfer is the
    // size of the region.
    //
    // region is in texels with the origin at the top-left. pixels points at the
    // region's own top-left, and its rows are tightly packed to the *region's*
    // width unless bytesPerRow gives a larger stride — so a glyph can be
    // uploaded straight out of a larger rasterization buffer by passing that
    // buffer's stride.
    //
    // A region that is empty, or that is not wholly inside the texture, is a
    // no-op. Deliberately not clamped: a clamped region would keep consuming
    // source rows at the original width and silently upload skewed pixels,
    // which is far harder to spot than nothing appearing.
    //
    // A no-op on a cube, which has six rectangles this could mean and no
    // argument to say which. Quietly writing +X would be exactly the kind of
    // silent wrong answer the out-of-bounds rule above exists to avoid.
    //
    // A no-op on a compressed texture too. A region there would have to start
    // and end on a 4x4 block boundary, so the rect a caller wrote and the rect
    // the GPU updated would differ by up to three texels a side - and nothing
    // that wants this wants it for compressed content, a glyph atlas being
    // uploaded a glyph at a time as it is rasterized.

    // only way what the GPU produced becomes bytes a program can look at: a
    // screenshot, a kernel's output image, a test asserting on what a pass
    // actually drew.
    //
    // dst receives rows tightly packed at the format's bytesPerPixel with row 0
    // at the top, unless bytesPerRow gives a larger stride — the same layout
    // update() reads, so a texture read out and uploaded back is the texture it
    // was. It must have room for the texture's (or the region's) height of them.
    //
    // **Valid once the work that drew the texture has been committed**, which is
    // the rule Buffer::read carries and the same trap. A pass recorded on a
    // Frame has not been: the frame's commands reach the GPU when the frame
    // ends, so a read inside the frame that drew it reads what was there
    // before. Frame::flush() is what makes it true, and is there for this.
    //
    // The copy goes through a staging buffer and blocks until the GPU has
    // finished it, so this is a stall by construction — a round trip to the
    // device per call. That is what a screenshot costs; it is not something to
    // put in a frame loop.

    // region update has not.
    //
    // And a no-op on a compressed texture. Handing back the blocks would need a
    // layout of its own and a decoder at the other end, and handing back texels
