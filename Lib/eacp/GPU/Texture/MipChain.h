// **Built on the CPU, and shared by both backends, deliberately.** Metal has
// generateMipmapsForTexture and D3D12 has no equivalent at all - a chain there
// is a compute shader, a UAV per level and a root signature to bind them. So
// the two obvious routes are a GPU chain on Metal against a hand-written one on
// Windows, which is two different filters producing two different pictures for
// the same texture, or one filter on the CPU producing the same bytes for both.
//
// The second is the only one a conformance test can check, and this library has
// been wrong about a cross-backend detail often enough to prefer the version
// that can be checked. The cost is that a mipmapped upload moves 4/3 of the
// pixels rather than 1, once, when the texture is created.
//
// **It is the default rather than the only way**: TextureDescriptor::mipLevels
// takes a chain the caller built, in exactly this layout, and the filter
// argument above still holds where it does - the two backends upload the same
// bytes because they were handed the same bytes. What that field is for is the
// two cases this cannot serve at all: a compressed texture, whose blocks have
// no average, and a caller whose own filter differs on purpose.
//
// Level 0 is a repacked copy of the source rather than a pointer into it, so
// the backends upload every level through one loop with one set of indices.
// One memcpy of a texture that is about to cross the bus anyway is not the
// expensive part of this.

//
// The average is of the stored values, not of light: an 8-bit texture holding
// sRGB is averaged in sRGB, which darkens a mip slightly against the physically
// correct answer. That is what every GPU's own mip generator does, eacp has no
// sRGB formats to distinguish the two cases with, and doing otherwise here
// would make eacp's mips disagree with every other tool that produced them.
