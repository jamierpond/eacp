// The backend half of frame timing: a fixed set of slots, each holding one
// in-flight frame's raw GPU timestamps.
//
// This is where the two backends stop resembling each other. Metal writes
// timestamps into an MTLCounterSampleBuffer named by a pass descriptor, and
// only ever at a pass boundary - Apple silicon supports counter sampling at
// MTLCounterSamplingPointAtStageBoundary and at none of the others, so there is
// no such thing as a timestamp in the middle of a pass. D3D12 writes them into
// a query heap at any point on the command list, and needs that heap resolved
// into a readback buffer by the list itself before anything can be read.
//
// So the seam is drawn here, and FrameTimer above it is portable. Nothing in
// this class knows what a pass is called or which frame is current.
