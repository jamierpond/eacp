# GPU

Metal on Apple platforms, D3D12 on Windows, behind one API — and a shader EDSL
that makes a shader a C++ struct rather than a string literal per backend.

Everything here is main-thread only, like the rest of eacp, and every public
type hides its backend behind a `Pimpl`, so nothing Metal or D3D leaks into a
header an app includes.

More precisely: everything belongs to the thread that made the `Device` it came
from, and `Device::shared()` belongs to the main thread whichever thread asked
for it first — every `GPUView` and every `Frame` drives that one from there. A
worker that wants the GPU without queueing behind the main thread makes a
`Device` of its own (`auto worker = GPU::Device();`) and keeps the whole chain —
buffers, pipelines, command buffers — on that thread; reaching `Device::shared()`
from there to compile a kernel is allowed and does not move its ownership.
`Device::assertOwningThread()` is the rule as a debug assertion, and creating a
buffer, reading or updating one, beginning a frame, and submitting, waiting on
or reading back a command buffer all call it. It is one thread-id compare behind
an `assert`, so a release build pays for nothing but the call.

This is new on Metal. D3D12 and Vulkan already asserted that the shared device
stayed on the main thread; on Metal nothing checked, so code that drove
`Device::shared()` from a worker — a background loader making buffers, a
thread submitting its own command buffers — ran, racing the main thread's use
of the same queue. It now stops at the assertion in a debug build. The fix is
the one above: give the worker its own `Device`.

## The pieces

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `Device` | The process-wide device and queue. `Device::shared()`, and `isValid()` on a machine with no GPU |
| `GPUView` | A `View` that owns a swapchain and hands you a `Frame` each tick |
| `Frame` | One frame's command buffer. Presents and commits on destruction |
| `RenderPass` | Records draws. Ends its encoder on destruction |
| `Buffer` | Vertex, index and storage buffers |
| `Texture` | 2D textures: uploaded, wrapped zero-copy from a camera buffer, or rendered into |
| `RenderPipeline` | A compiled pipeline state |
| `CommandBuffer` / `ComputePass` | The compute path — off-screen, blocking or not; `Frame::beginCompute` puts one on a frame |
| `Codegen/` | The shader EDSL and the MSL / HLSL emitters |

## A shader

`define()` records a graph of value handles. Nothing in it is text: the emitters
turn that one source into MSL and into HLSL, so the two backends cannot drift
apart on a shader an app wrote once.

```cpp
#include <eacp/GPU/GPU.h>

using namespace eacp;
using namespace eacp::GPU;

struct Vertex
{
    float position[2];
};

EACP_SHADER_VALUE(Vertex, Float2)

struct Waves final : ShaderProgram
{
    Waves() { compile(); }

    void define() override
    {
        auto position = vertexInput(&Vertex::position);
        auto uv = varying(position);

        setPosition(float4(position, 0.f, 1.f));
        setFragment(float4(0.5f + 0.5f * sin(uv.x() * 8.f + time), uv.y(), 0.f, 1.f));
    }

    Uniform<Float> time;

    EACP_SHADER(time)
};
```

`compile()` runs from the most-derived constructor: it walks the uniform members
that `EACP_SHADER` names and then calls `define()` through the vtable. After
that, `prepare(sampleCount)` builds the library and the pipeline, and
`pass.draw(shader)` binds everything and issues the draw.

The uniform block is bound only to the stage that reads one. Which stage that is
comes from the same walk the emitter declares the block from, so a bind cannot
disagree with the signature it is aimed at — and a stage that never declared it
is not bound at all, which is what Metal's validation layer otherwise reports as
an unused binding. App code that takes `draw(program)` apart to draw its own
geometry should call `pass.setUniforms(program)` rather than the two per-stage
setters, for the same reason.

### The CPU types a shader value is fed from

A vertex field or a uniform can be any CPU type whose shape the shader layer
knows. `float`, `float[N]` and `std::array<float, N>` are built in; a type of
your own says so with `EACP_SHADER_VALUE` (or a `using ShaderValue = Float3;`
member), and `Core/Maths` arrives already registered — `Maths::Vec2`, `Vec3`,
`Vec4` and a column-major `Maths::Mat4`, all packed exactly as the float2 /
float3 / float4 / float4x4 they stand for.

That is the whole point of them: the same value does the CPU-side geometry and
crosses to the GPU with nothing to repack or transpose.

```cpp
using namespace eacp::Maths;

struct Vertex
{
    Vec3 position;
    Vec3 normal;
};

// ... in the view:
auto view = Mat4::lookAt(eye, {0.f, 0.f, 0.f}, {0.f, 1.f, 0.f});
auto projection = Mat4::perspective(aspect, radians(50.f), 0.1f, 200.f);

shader.viewProjection = projection * view;   // Uniform<Float4x4>
shader.lightDirection = normalize(eye);      // Uniform<Float3>
```

`Mat4` is right-handed with a `[0, 1]` depth range — what both backends clip
against, and what `ShaderProgram::perspective` builds — so a matrix assembled on
the CPU and one assembled inside `define()` mean the same thing. Apps/GPU has
both: `Teapot` and `Maze` send scalars and let the shader build the matrices,
`CubeMap` and `StencilShadows` build them here and send the result.

### Naming the pipeline's state

`prepare` also takes a `RenderPipelineDescriptor`, which is the form to reach for
once more than one of these is not the shader's own choice:

```cpp
auto descriptor = RenderPipelineDescriptor {};
descriptor.sampleCount = sampleCount();
descriptor.depth = true;
descriptor.blendMode = BlendMode::AlphaBlend;
descriptor.cullMode = CullMode::Back;

program.prepare(descriptor);
```

The program fills in its own library and vertex layout, so those two fields are
ignored. The positional `prepare(sampleCount, depth, topology, blend, format)`
still exists and means exactly the same thing; it just says less at the call
site, and the fields past `depth` are usually the *target's* answers rather than
the shader's.

### Blending past the four named modes

`BlendMode`'s presets are what a UI, a sprite or a glyph wants. What they do not
cover is content whose *author* chose the equation — a material system, where
"modulate by what is behind me" is something written in a file that the renderer
has to honour rather than approximate. `blend` takes the equation itself and
wins over `blendMode` when set:

```cpp
auto blend = BlendState {};
blend.enabled = true;
blend.sourceColor = BlendFactor::DestinationColor;   // `blend filter`
blend.destinationColor = BlendFactor::Zero;
blend.sourceAlpha = BlendFactor::DestinationAlpha;
blend.destinationAlpha = BlendFactor::Zero;

descriptor.blend = blend;
```

`blendStateFor(mode)` writes a preset out in the same terms, and is what both
backends build from — so a preset means one thing, stated once.

`colorWriteMask` is beside it and independent of it: which channels reach the
attachment after the blend. `ColorWriteMask::none()` is a pass that updates the
depth or stencil plane and leaves the picture alone, which is what a shadow
volume being counted needs; per-channel masking has no workaround at all and is
why the field exists rather than the trick that used to stand in for it.

### Face culling, and which way round front is

`CullMode::None` is the default: both faces rasterise, which is what a mesh whose
winding is not known to be consistent needs. Under `Front` or `Back` a
wrongly-wound triangle does not draw wrongly — it does not draw at all.

**A triangle whose vertices run counter-clockwise in clip space — the space
`setPosition` writes, with y up — is front-facing.** That is glTF's convention,
and it is stated here in clip space rather than in the image because the viewport
flips y on the way and reverses the answer.

It is worth stating at all because both backends' own defaults read "clockwise is
front-facing", which is the opposite of the convention above. What they do not
differ on is what winding means: clip-space y is up and the framebuffer origin is
top left on each, so the NDC-to-screen mapping reverses winding by the same
amount on both and one convention is spelled the same way twice —
`MTLWindingCounterClockwise` on one side, `FrontCounterClockwise = TRUE` on the
other. `Tests/GPU/CullModeTests.cpp` is what fails if either drifts.

### What the EDSL has

- `Float`, `Float2/3/4`, `Float2x2`, `Float3x3`, `Float4x4` — built from their
  columns, transposed, and their determinant taken; multiplied by a vector on
  either side, which is a different product each way, and scaled by a scalar,
  which is neither. There is no `inverse`, and that is the languages rather
  than this: GLSL has one, MSL and HLSL do not
- `Int` and `Int2/3/4` — signed, with `%`, the bitwise set, the shifts, the
  comparisons, and the explicit crossings `toInt` / `toFloat`
- `Bool` and `Bool2/3/4` — what a comparison yields, collapsed by `any()` /
  `all()`, compared with each other, and crossed into a number with `toInt` /
  `toFloat`. Comparing two vectors is the operator itself, componentwise,
  because that is what both shading languages give a pair of vectors
- `UInt` for the compute thread id, a buffer index, an element of an integer
  buffer, and the slot an atomic add reserved — compared against each other and
  against unsigned literals, and carrying the whole integer operator set the
  signed scalar does: `%`, the bitwise set, the shifts and `~`, each against
  another `UInt` or an unsigned literal on either side. `unsignedInteger(n)` is
  the literal itself as a handle, the unsigned sibling of `constant`, `boolean`
  and `integer`
- `UInt2/3/4` — the unsigned vectors, carrying that same set componentwise
  wherever the signed ones carry theirs, arithmetic wrapping at 2^32 rather than
  overflowing a sign, plus the crossings `toUInt` / `toInt` / `toFloat` and the
  bitcasts `asUInt` / `asFloat`
- Every swizzle of up to four components, on all four families, as one node
- The intrinsic set, spelled the way the languages underneath spell it —
  `rsqrt`, `atan2`, `mix` — rather than the way GLSL does, and taking a float
  literal in any argument position: `smoothstep(0.0, w, d)` mixes a literal edge
  with a computed one, `min(0.0, g)` puts the literal first, `step(d, 0.0)`
  second. A literal is anchored on the graph whichever argument is a handle
  brought, so which positions accept one is not a question the EDSL has an
  opinion about
- The transcendentals a network's activations are written out of: `sinh`,
  `cosh`, `tanh` and `log10`, which both languages have natively, and `erf` /
  `erfc`, which neither has at all — those two are emitted as a polynomial held
  to under 6e-7 absolute, so a shader can spell the exact GELU rather than the
  tanh approximation of it. The origin is exact, which the polynomial on its own
  is not: `erf` is odd across it bit for bit and zero at it, `erfc` is one
  there, and the two sum to one
- `saturatingTanh`, which is `tanh` with its two tails answered rather than
  computed: exactly ±1 from an argument of ten outward, the native builtin
  inside it.
  What the native one does with a large argument is the driver's business, and
  eacp compiles its Metal library with no `MTLCompileOptions` — so fast math is
  on, `tanh` is evaluated through `exp`, and `tanh(990)` comes back NaN. A tanh
  GELU cubes its input on the way in, so an activation of thirty arrives as
  exactly that argument. Float32 resolves nothing between `tanh(9.011)` and one,
  so every argument answered with a constant is one whose correctly rounded tanh
  is that constant: it is a repair of the tails, not a different function. Reach
  for it wherever the argument is not bounded by construction
- Statements: `var`, `select`, `ifThen`, `loop`, `breakLoop`, `continueLoop`.
  A `var` takes any handle and any matrix. `select` runs across every family —
  a float, an index, an integer vector, a mask — and takes a literal on either
  side of a scalar one; the condition is a scalar `Bool` in all of them, which
  is the conditional operator both languages already print
- Compute-only: `atomicAdd`, `shared<T>(count)`, `barrier`, `localId`, the
  group-wide `groupSum` / `groupMax` / `groupMin` and their SIMD-group-scoped
  siblings `simdSum` / `simdMax` / `simdMin`, and the SIMD-group matrix —
  `simdGroupIndex`, `simdMatrix`, `multiplyAccumulate` and the `write` that
  stores a fragment — see the compute section
- `Array<T, N>` with a subscript, at a literal or a computed index
- Texture reads: `sample`, `sample` at a chosen level, and `fetch` at texel
  coordinates

There is no aggregate type and none is needed: the EDSL is embedded in C++, so a
struct of handles is a C++ struct.

```cpp
struct Hit
{
    Float distance;
    Float3 albedo;
};
```

### What it deliberately refuses

`ShaderBuilder::uniform<T>()` static_asserts rather than leaving these to a
comment, because each is a case where the two backends disagree about the
packing *inside* a value and no padding between fields can bridge it:

- `Bool` and the boolean vectors — MSL packs a `bool` into a byte, an HLSL
  cbuffer gives it four
- `Float2x2` and `Float3x3` — MSL packs a `float2x2` as two `float2` columns,
  16 bytes; an HLSL cbuffer gives every matrix row a register and takes 32.
  `Float4x4`, which both agree on, is the matrix to send

Send a `Float` and compare it; send a `Float4x4`. `Int` and the integer vectors
*are* uniforms — both languages give a signed integer four bytes and pack it
where they pack a float.

`ShaderBuilder::varying<T>()` refuses one type for a different reason: a `Bool`
varying. GLSL allows no boolean stage input or output, and no `flat` qualifier
changes that, so there is no source the emitter could print that would compile.
Carry an `Int` across and test it, or carry the comparison's operands and
compare in the fragment stage. An `Int` or `UInt` varying, signed or unsigned
vectors included, crosses uninterpolated — the emitter writes `flat`,
`nointerpolation` or `[[flat]]` for it on its own, since every dialect requires
that of an integer.

### The emitted text is checked in

Every shader the library ships — each ML kernel in every variant its
constructor takes, the GPUWidgets kernels and shaders, both sprite shaders in
all four sampling configurations, and the UI and text renderers' programs — is
emitted as MSL, HLSL and GLSL by `ShaderGoldenTests` and compared byte for byte
with `Tests/GPU/Golden/<Module>/<Kernel>[.<variant>].{msl,hlsl,glsl}`;
StableAudio3's own kernels do the same in `SA3ShaderGoldenTests` against
`Apps/GPU/StableAudio3/Tests/ShaderGolden/`. A change to the emitter that moves
any of that text fails with a diff of the first lines that moved. When the
move is the point, run the suite with `EACP_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1` to rewrite the
files (and delete any no kernel produces any more) and commit them with the
change, so the review shows every kernel it touched. A new kernel is one line
in the list in `Tests/GPU/ShaderGoldenTests.cpp`; a golden no line produces
fails `ShaderGolden/noOrphans`.

## Pipeline state

`prepare(sampleCount)` covers the common settings positionally. Everything else
a pipeline can be told goes through the descriptor form, which is the same
`RenderPipelineDescriptor` a hand-written shader fills in:

```cpp
shader.prepare({.sampleCount = sampleCount(),
                .depth = true,
                .cullMode = CullMode::Back});
```

**Depth is three fields, not one.** `depth` says the pipeline has a depth
attachment — the view has to have one too (`setDepth(true)`), and both backends
reject a draw whose pipeline disagrees with the pass about that. `depthCompare`
and `depthWrite` are what to do with it, and they come apart where it matters:
translucent geometry tests against the opaque depth already written and must not
write its own, or the nearer of two translucent surfaces hides the further one
instead of blending over it.

```cpp
opaque.prepare({.sampleCount = 1, .depth = true});                    // the default: LessEqual, writing
glass.prepare({.sampleCount = 1, .depth = true, .depthWrite = false}); // tests, does not write
```

**Culling is off by default, and the front face is counter-clockwise in clip
space** — glTF's convention, spelled out under "Face culling, and which way round
front is" above. `frontFace` is there for the geometry that does not arrive in
it: a mesh wound the other way, an instance mirrored by a negative scale, or an
inside-out shape like a skybox, none of which should need its indices rewritten.

```cpp
skybox.prepare({.sampleCount = 1, .cullMode = CullMode::Back,
                .frontFace = Winding::Clockwise});
```

Culling is pipeline state on D3D12 and encoder state on Metal. eacp hides that:
`RenderPass::setPipeline` applies both the mode and the winding on every bind, so
a pass that draws a culled mesh and then a full-screen quad gets the same picture
either way — `PipelineStateTests` covers that, and `CullModeTests` covers the
convention itself.

## Viewport, and how it differs from a scissor

`setScissorRect` clips: geometry outside the rect is thrown away, and what
survives is where it always was. `setViewport` **remaps**: clip space lands on
the rect instead of on the whole target, so the same vertices are drawn
somewhere else, at some other size.

```cpp
pass.setViewport({0.f, 0.f, width / 2.f, height});   // left pane
scene.drawFrom(leftCamera, pass);
pass.setViewport({width / 2.f, 0.f, width / 2.f, height});  // right pane
scene.drawFrom(rightCamera, pass);
pass.clearViewport();
```

That is split screen, a shadow map into one tile of an atlas, or a thumbnail —
none of which a scissor can do, because a scissor at the right-hand rect would
delete the geometry rather than move it. Both take pixels with the origin at the
top-left, like `Graphics::Rect`.

The optional `near`/`far` remap the depth a fragment writes. A viewport of
`[0.5, 1]` puts everything drawn through it behind everything drawn at the
default `[0, 1]`, whatever the geometry's own z says — which is how a layer gets
forced behind or in front of something it does not otherwise sort against.

**A rect that is empty or not wholly inside the render target is ignored**, not
clamped — the same rule `Texture::update` applies to regions, for the same
reason. A clamped scissor still shows the caller what they asked for; a clamped
viewport keeps drawing and silently squashes the picture into a rectangle nobody
chose, which looks like a bug in the caller's own maths. Neither backend forces
this: Metal accepts an out-of-target viewport happily. It is eacp's choice, and
`ViewportTests` is what holds the two backends to it.

## Rendering into a texture

A texture created with `TextureDescriptor::renderTarget` can be drawn into and
then sampled. It is a **pass on the frame you were already given**, not a frame
of its own:

```cpp
void render(Frame& frame) override
{
    {
        auto into = frame.beginPass(target, {{0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f}});
        into.draw(writer);
    }

    auto pass = frame.beginPass();
    pass.draw(reader);          // reader.image = target
}
```

Passes on one command buffer are ordered by the queue, so a texture written by
an earlier one is legal to sample in a later one and neither backend needs a
fence to say so. That is the whole reason this is a pass rather than a frame:
`OffscreenTarget` — the snapshot path `View::renderToImage` rides on — blocks
until the GPU has finished, and a multi-pass effect would stall once per pass.

A texture cannot be sampled by the same pass rendering into it. Two of them and
a swap is the answer to that, which is what a feedback buffer is made of.

The pipeline has to agree with what it draws into: `prepare(...)` takes a
`PixelFormat`, and a program targeting a texture passes
`pixelFormatFor(itsFormat)`. Neither backend takes a draw whose pipeline
disagrees with its attachment.

### Depth

A target drawing a 3D scene needs a depth buffer, and asks for one on the same
descriptor:

```cpp
auto texture = TextureDescriptor {};
texture.renderTarget = true;
texture.depth = true;                                 // the pass gets one

auto pipeline = RenderPipelineDescriptor {};
pipeline.sampleCount = texture.sampleCount;           // 1 unless it multisamples
pipeline.depth = true;                                // the pipeline tests it
pipeline.colorFormat = pixelFormatFor(texture.format);

program.prepare(pipeline);
```

The buffer belongs to the target, is created with it and dies with it, so there
is no second lifetime to keep in step. Every pass into the texture clears it to
the far plane and stores nothing.

The two flags have to agree. A pipeline that declares depth drawing into a
target that has none is a validation error on Metal and an untested draw on
D3D12 — and on Apple silicon it *appears* to work, because the tile memory is
there whether or not anything attached it. Do not read that as permission;
`Texture::hasDepth()` is what a pipeline should be built from.

### Multisampling a target

`TextureDescriptor::sampleCount` above 1 grows a multisampled colour texture
beside the target: the pass renders into that one and resolves into the target
at the end of *every* pass, so what a shader samples, what `read()` reads and
what a blit copies is always the resolved picture.

```cpp
auto texture = TextureDescriptor {};
texture.renderTarget = true;
texture.stencil = true;                  // the depth buffer comes at the same count
texture.sampleCount = 4;

auto target = Device::shared().makeTexture(texture);   // invalid if 4 is refused
```

Three things follow from it and are worth knowing before reaching for it.

The count has to reach every pipeline that draws there —
`RenderPipelineDescriptor::sampleCount = target.sampleCount()` — and both
backends reject a draw where the two disagree.

A count the device cannot render at makes the texture **invalid** rather than
quietly dropping to 1, since a silent drop would leave every pipeline compiled
against a number the pass does not have. `Device::supportsSampleCount()` is how
to pick one before building anything.

The samples are *kept* as well as resolved, so a pass that does not clear loads
the multisampled attachment back rather than the flattened picture — which is
what makes a suspended pass (`DepthAction::Resume`) and a mid-frame copy of the
target work at 4 samples the same way they do at 1. `sampleableDepth` costs a
second depth buffer here: the shaders eacp generates declare a `depth2d`, so the
depth plane is resolved into a single-sampled twin and that is what
`setFragmentDepthTexture` binds.

## Compute

A kernel is a `ComputeProgram`: storage buffers and uniforms as members, the
body in `define()`, dispatched over one index per element. Two places take one.

The grid comes from what the body asks for. `threadId()` gives a single index
and is dispatched with `dispatch(count)`, in groups of 64; `threadPosition()`
gives an `x` and a `y` and is dispatched with `dispatch(width, height)`, in 8×8
groups; `threadPosition3()` adds a `z` and is dispatched with
`dispatch(width, height, depth)`, in 4×4×4 groups — what anything natively
indexed by three numbers wants, an attention score by (key, query, head) among
them, rather than a third axis folded into a row on the host. A kernel takes one
of the three — the generated entry point has one shape — and every extent is
bounds-checked for you, so a grid that is not a multiple of the group is safe to
dispatch.

`threadId2()` and `threadId3()` are those same two positions as one value — a
`UInt2` and a `UInt3` that swizzle, compare and compute like any other vector
handle — with `localId2()`/`localId3()` and `groupId2()`/`groupId3()` beside
`localId()` and `groupId()` on the same terms. Either spelling of a rank fixes
it, so `threadId2()` and `threadPosition()` sit in one kernel and a 2D index
next to a 3D one still does not.

```cpp
void define() override
{
    auto p = threadPosition();
    write(output, p.y * stride + p.x, toFloat(p.x));
}

pass.dispatch(kernel, width, height);
```

### The group a kernel is dispatched in

Those three shapes are the defaults, not the only ones. A kernel that wants a
different group says so before `compile()`, by handing a `ThreadGroupShape` to
the base constructor, and everything downstream follows it: the emitted
`[numthreads(...)]` and `layout(local_size_...)`, and the threadgroup the pass
dispatches in.

```cpp
struct RowSum final : ComputeProgram
{
    RowSum() : ComputeProgram({256}) { compile(); }

    void define() override
    {
        auto lane = localId();                     // now runs to 256
        auto scratch = shared<Float>(groupShape().x);
        ...
    }
};
```

`{256}` is a 1D group of 256; `{16, 16}` is the 2D group a tiled product wants;
a third number is the depth. `ComputeProgram()` — the constructor everything
here used until now — keeps the stock shape, so a kernel that says nothing is
dispatched exactly as before, and `ComputePass::threadGroupWidth`,
`threadGroupSize2D` and `threadGroupSize3D` still spell what "nothing" means.

`groupShape()` is the shape this kernel really has, and is what a shared tile
and a lane's stride are sized against. Read it inside `define()` **after** the
body has asked for its thread index: a kernel that named no shape resolves one
from its rank, and the rank is what `threadId()` or `threadPosition()` fixes.

Wider is not automatically faster. A group-per-row sum over 1500 floats runs
1.7× *slower* at 256 lanes than at 64 when there are 1500 rows to sum, because
64 lanes already saturate memory bandwidth and the extra lanes only add barriers
— and 1.4× faster at 32 rows, where there is not enough work to fill the machine
and a wider group is what hides the latency. It is a knob to measure, not one to
turn up.

The group is also a device limit: Metal reports `maxTotalThreadsPerThreadgroup`
per pipeline, and a kernel asking for more than that is reported at `prepare()`
rather than dispatching nothing.

`Device::makeCommandBuffer()` is the off-screen path — compute with no frame
around it. `commit()` submits and waits; `commitAsync()` submits and returns a
`Threads::Async<void>` that resolves once the GPU is done:

```cpp
auto commands = device.makeCommandBuffer();

{
    auto pass = commands.beginCompute();
    pass.dispatch(kernel, count);
}

commands.commitAsync().then([&] { /* output is ready */ });
// ...the CPU carries on here, while the kernel runs
```

Nothing about correctness changes between the two. `Buffer::read()` orders
behind the submission itself, so a read before the `Async` resolves is still
right — it just waits by hand for what the overlap was there to avoid.

### A kernel built once

Constructing a `ComputeProgram` records its graph and emits its source, and
`prepare()` hands that source to the shader compiler — MSL through
`newLibraryWithSource` and a pipeline state on Metal, DXC and
`CreateComputePipelineState` on D3D12, glslang and a `VkPipeline` on Vulkan.
Code that builds a kernel where it dispatches it pays all of that on every call,
which for a layer of a network is thousands of times a step.

Two things take that away, one of them without anything to write. `prepare()`
keeps what it compiled on the `Device`, keyed by everything the backend compiles
from — backend, entry point, thread group, bindings and the text itself — so a
second kernel that emits the same source shares the first one's library and
pipeline, whoever built it. The emission is still paid for, though: 221 µs for a
tiled matrix product in a release build, 3 ms in a debug one. `sharedKernel`
skips that as well, handing back the one prepared instance of a kernel type on a
device:

```cpp
Tensor scale(ComputePass& pass, const Tensor& input, float by, Device& device)
{
    auto result = Tensor::uninitializedF32(input.shape(), device);

    auto& kernel = sharedKernel<ScaleKernel>(device);   // built on first use
    kernel.input = input.buffer();
    kernel.output = result.buffer();
    kernel.scale = by;
    kernel.dispatch(pass, input.count());

    return result;
}
```

The instance is shared by every caller, which is safe for the reason a kernel
could always be dispatched twice: the dispatch copies the uniforms and binds the
buffers there and then. What sharing does ask is that each call assigns every
member it declares, and for buffers and textures that is enforced. A shared
instance lets go of its buffer and texture members once a dispatch has bound
them, so the range a caller assigned never outlives the buffer it points into,
and a dispatch that finds one unassigned throws `std::logic_error` naming the
kernel and the member instead of binding what the last caller left. Uniform
values are copied into each dispatch and kept: a forgotten one is the last
caller's value, not the zero a fresh kernel would have held — a wrong answer
rather than freed memory, and the reason each call still sets them all.

Any kernel, shared or not, throws the same way when a buffer or texture member
was never assigned at all. A kernel its owner holds keeps what was assigned to
it across dispatches, which is how a kernel dispatched every frame over the same
buffers is written; `releaseBindingsAfterEachDispatch()` gives it the shared
rule. Constructor arguments are part of what tells two kernels apart, so a
kernel with variants is `sharedKernel<ActivationKernel>(device,
ActivationKind::SiLU)`; they must be integers or enums.

The first use builds the kernel, and there is nothing to list ahead of time:
**compiled shaders are cached on disk by default**, so a kernel pays the shader
compiler once per machine rather than once per launch. Each backend keeps the
half it would otherwise redo:

- **Metal** keeps its own cache of compiled libraries and pipelines, keyed by
  the source it was handed, so nothing is added on top of it. Measured on an
  M5 Max over the 32 kernels a Stable Audio medium run builds: 0.3–0.5 s of
  compiling on a machine that had never seen them, 0.00 s on every run after.
- **D3D12** keeps the bytecode FXC produced, and **Vulkan** the SPIR-V glslang
  produced, in `FilePath::appCacheDirectory() / "Shaders"`
  (`ShaderBinaryCache`), found by the compiler's version and everything the
  compile read. The Vulkan driver's own half is the `VkPipelineCache` beside it
  in the same folder.

A newer compiler or a changed source is a miss and a fresh compile, never a
stale binary, and a cache that cannot be read or written is simply a compile.
`callCosts()` reports `"shader compiles"` and `"kernel builds"` — how many
there were and what they cost — for a run that wants to see it.

### Waiting for one command buffer

What `Buffer::read()` waits for is the *newest* submission, and so for every
earlier one too. That is the right default — the buffer has no way to know
which submission wrote the bytes being asked for — and it is exactly wrong for
a loop that keeps more than one command buffer in flight: step k's result
cannot be read while step k+1 is running, because the read waits for both.

`wait()` is the scoped version. It blocks until *this* command buffer's work
has finished and for nothing submitted after it, returns at once when the work
has already landed, and does nothing at all on a buffer that was never
committed. `isComplete()` asks the same question without blocking.
`CommandBuffer::read()` is `Buffer::read()` scoped the same way: that wait, and
then the copy.

```cpp
commands.submit();                        // no wait, nothing to resolve
commands.wait();                          // this buffer only
commands.read(output, values.data(), bytes);
```

`submit()` is the third way to hand work over, beside `commit()` and
`commitAsync()`. The `Async` the latter returns settles on the message thread,
so a loop that blocks in `wait()` and never gives that thread a turn would
never see it resolve; `submit()` is that submission with the completion half
left to `wait()`. All three are the same submission, and a second one on the
same command buffer does nothing whichever was used.

Which is what a pipelined loop of small steps is built out of — record and
submit step k+1 while step k is still running on the GPU, then wait for step k
and read it:

```cpp
// Two in the air at a time: one running, one being recorded. A CommandBuffer
// is neither copyable nor movable, so the ring holds them in place.
std::optional<CommandBuffer> inFlight[2];

for (auto step = 0; step < stepCount; ++step)
{
    auto& commands = inFlight[step % 2].emplace(device);

    {
        kernel.step = (unsigned) step;
        auto pass = commands.beginCompute();
        pass.dispatch(kernel, count);
    }

    commands.submit();

    // One behind: the CPU has recorded and submitted step k+1 before it asks
    // the GPU for step k, so the two overlap instead of taking turns.
    if (step > 0)
        inFlight[(step - 1) % 2]->read(state, &results[step - 1], sizeof(float));
}
```

Command buffers on one queue run in the order they were submitted, so step k+1
reads what step k wrote without anything being said about it — the dependency
is the queue's, not the caller's. A command buffer whose work is still running
may be destroyed; what may not happen is reading its output without a `wait()`
or a `read()` of its own first.

The scoped read is a memcpy after the wait on Metal, where a storage buffer is
CPU-visible. On D3D12 and Vulkan the copy out of a device-heap buffer is itself
a submission, which the in-order queue puts behind whatever was submitted in
between, so the wait is scoped there and the copy is not. It is still the right
call — it is the only shape a readback has on those backends — but a loop that
reads every step will overlap less there than it does here.

`Frame::beginCompute()` is the other one: a compute pass on the frame's own
command buffer, ordered with its render passes the way two render passes are.
That is what lets a kernel's output feed the draw that consumes it, with the
data never reaching the CPU:

```cpp
void render(Frame& frame) override
{
    {
        auto compute = frame.beginCompute();
        compute.dispatch(integrate, particleCount);   // writes `state`
    }

    auto pass = frame.beginPass();
    draw.setInstanceBuffer(1, state, particleCount);  // reads the same buffer
    pass.drawInstanced(draw, particleCount);
}
```

`setInstanceBuffer` is `setInstances`' counterpart for data the program does not
own: the bytes a kernel wrote as a flat float array are read by the vertex stage
at the per-instance stride `instanceInput()` declared. One buffer, two views of
it, no copy.

**Within one pass, the dispatches are ordered.** Every dispatch sees the writes
of every dispatch recorded before it in the same pass, on all three backends, so
a chain of stages is a chain of `dispatch` calls and does not need a pass each.
Between passes the ordering is the queue's, which is the same promise a second
time.

### Dispatches that overlap

That ordering is not free: a dispatch waits for the one before it to drain even
when the two share nothing, and for a stage whose grid is a few hundred threads
the wait is most of what the stage costs. A chain of sixty small kernels pays it
sixty times.

`DispatchOrder::Concurrent` lifts it, and `ComputePass::barrier()` puts it back
exactly where one stage does read what another wrote:

```cpp
auto pass = commands.beginCompute("attention", DispatchOrder::Concurrent);

for (auto head = 0; head < heads; ++head)
{
    scores.output = BufferRange {&allScores, head * stride, stride};
    pass.dispatch(scores, keys);       // the heads share nothing
}

pass.barrier();                        // every score is written before...
pass.dispatch(combine, width);         // ...anything reads one
```

Everything recorded before a `barrier()` completes — its buffer and texture
writes visible — before anything recorded after it begins. A `barrier()` after
every dispatch is the serial pass again and measurably slower than one, so this
is worth reaching for where there is real independence and not otherwise.

The end of the pass is a barrier of its own: what the next pass, a `fill` or a
`Buffer::read` sees from a serial pass, it sees from a concurrent one.
`barrier()` in a serial pass is a no-op, so a chain can be written once and
switched between the two by its argument alone. `Frame::beginCompute` takes the
same second argument and means the same thing by it, and an unlabelled pass
spells the label it is not giving: `beginCompute({}, DispatchOrder::Concurrent)`.

This is not the `barrier()` a kernel body calls. That one is inside a single
dispatch, across the threads of one group — see **Threadgroup memory** below.

### In place

An elementwise stage rewrites the buffer it was handed rather than filling a
second one. The buffer is bound once, to an output slot, and the kernel reads
the element it is about to store to:

```cpp
void define() override
{
    auto i = threadId();
    auto x = output[i];

    write(output, i, 0.5f * x * (1.0f + erf(x * 0.70710678f)));
}
```

Within one thread, statements run in the order they were written, so the read
observes what the element held. Another thread's store is visible only once the
dispatch has ended, so this is for a 1:1 stage and not for one that reads its
neighbours.

Binding one `GPU::Buffer` to an input slot **and** an output slot of the same
kernel is the form that does not port: D3D12 needs the resource in a different
state for each of those two bindings, and the second bind transitions it out
from under the first. It would not read as an in-place kernel anyway — a value
read through one slot keeps its name across a store to another, so the second
use of it is the value from before the store.

### Timing a pass

A pass given a label is timed by the hardware, on a command buffer exactly as on
a frame. The numbers come off the buffer itself once the GPU has finished it —
after `commit()` or `wait()`, or after the `Async` from `commitAsync()` has
resolved:

```cpp
{
    auto pass = commands.beginCompute("attention");
    pass.dispatch(attention, count);
}

commands.commit();

for (const auto& pass: commands.timings().passes)
    log(pass.label, pass.milliseconds);
```

`timings().milliseconds` is the buffer end to end. An unlabelled pass is not
timed and does not appear, and a command buffer with no labelled pass at all
builds no timestamp resources; `supportsPassTimings()` says whether this device
can break a buffer down by pass, as `Device::supportsPassTimings()` does for a
frame.

A command buffer times every labelled region it is given. Its samples come in
sets of `GpuTimestamps::maxTimedPasses` (2,048) regions — 32 KB of them on
Metal, the most one counter sample buffer holds, and a 4,098-entry query heap
with its readback buffer on D3D12 and Vulkan — and the 2,049th region takes a
second set, paid only when a labelled pass asks. A frame times its first 2,048
and runs the rest untimed, so a tail past that is missing from its breakdown
rather than the frame being wrong.

### Timing each kernel

A pass times as one region, which says how long a network step took and not
where. `TimingScope::EachDispatch` makes every kernel the pass dispatches a
region of its own, named after the kernel, and `totalsByLabel()` folds them into
a profile:

```cpp
{
    auto pass = commands.beginCompute(
        "step", DispatchOrder::Serial, TimingScope::EachDispatch);
    forward(pass, weights, latent);             // hundreds of dispatches
}

commands.commit();

for (const auto& kernel: commands.timings().totalsByLabel())
    log(kernel.label, kernel.milliseconds, kernel.count);
```

```
step/LinearF32                      114.36 ms    181 dispatches
step/UnmaskedAttentionScoresKernel   48.91 ms     96 dispatches
step/AttentionWeightedSumKernel      42.11 ms     96 dispatches
...
```

That is one Stable Audio medium DiT step, 1,542 dispatches. A region is
named `pass/Kernel`, or `Kernel` for an unlabelled pass, where the kernel's name
is its type's without namespaces; a `ComputeProgram` that builds variants of one
type overrides `name()` to tell them apart. Only the program dispatches are
regions — a raw `dispatch(count)` runs inside whichever region is open.

It costs nothing unless asked for, and it is for finding where the time goes,
not for shipping. On D3D12 and Vulkan a timed dispatch is a pair of timestamps
written around it in the one command list. Apple silicon samples its counters
only where an encoder starts and ends, so on Metal each timed dispatch is an
encoder of its own; consecutive encoders may overlap on the GPU, so the
regions can sum to a little more than the command buffer's own time, and the
dispatches of a `Concurrent` pass stop overlapping altogether.

### What the CPU pays the driver

Some of a backend's cost never reaches the GPU's clock: a D3D12
`CreateCommittedResource` for every fresh buffer, a CPU block on a fence. Each is
a fraction of a millisecond, spread across a run, and invisible in a phase
timing. A `CallCostCounter` sums one kind of call, and `callCosts()` lists every
counter alive, so an app prints them beside its other timings:

```cpp
static auto creations = CallCostCounter {"buffers"};
auto cost = ScopedCallCost {creations, bytes};     // timed until scope end
device->CreateCommittedResource(...);

for (const auto& cost: callCosts())
    log(cost.label, cost.calls, cost.seconds, cost.meanMicroseconds(), cost.bytes);
```

Nothing is printed on its own and nothing is switched on by the environment: a
counter costs one clock read per call either way, and reading the totals is
the caller's decision.


### Zeroing a buffer

`fill` writes a byte over a whole buffer or over a range of one, on the GPU:

```cpp
commands.fill(cache);                                        // zeroed
commands.fill(BufferRange {&cache, rowBytes * step, rowBytes}, 0xff);
```

It is recorded on the command buffer like a pass, and ordered like one: a kernel
dispatched after the fill reads what the fill wrote, and a fill after a kernel
overwrites what the kernel wrote. The offset and the length must be multiples of
4, and no pass may be open. Nothing reaches the host, which is the point — a
cache re-zeroed between passes used to be an upload of zeros per pass.

### Temporaries are recycled

`Device::makeBuffer(bytes)` — the uninitialised buffer every compute
temporary is — takes its storage from the device's `BufferPool`, and a buffer
made that way hands its storage back when it is destroyed. Nothing to call, and
nothing to hold on to: a loop that records the same work again and again, an
inference step or a frame's compute, stops asking the device for fresh memory
for every temporary each time round.

That matters more than an allocation sounds. A fresh buffer's pages are zeroed
and made resident before the command buffer that first uses it can run: 1,587
temporaries a step cost a 290 ms Stable Audio DiT step 75 ms of it on an M5 Max,
and recycling them brought the step to the 215 ms its kernels take. On D3D12
each fresh buffer is a `CreateCommittedResource`.

Storage is never handed out while the GPU may still use it. A buffer destroyed
now can be named by everything already submitted and by the command buffer
still being recorded, so its storage waits until the GPU has finished the next
submission after it — which is what `Device::lastSubmission()` and
`hasFinished()` are there to answer, on every backend without blocking. The one
order that promise does not cover is two command buffers recorded at once and
submitted out of order, the older after the newer, with a buffer destroyed
between.

Reuse is by exact size and usage, and storage no `makeBuffer` has asked for
through a few submissions is freed, so the pool holds on to what the work still
uses and not to what it has moved on from. Buffers made with data, and adopted
memory, never come from it.

What changes for a caller is only what "uninitialised" always allowed: the
contents of a new buffer are whatever was there. A kernel that needs zeros says
so with `fill`.

In practice that is a change on Metal. There `makeBuffer(bytes)` used to be a
fresh `newBufferWithLength`, whose pages the OS hands over zeroed, so code that
accumulated into a new buffer, or read back a part no kernel wrote, got zeros
without asking. It now gets whatever the last owner of that storage left. D3D12
already recycled default-heap buffers and Vulkan never zeroed, so code that was
right on those backends is unaffected. To migrate, `commands.fill(buffer)`
before the first kernel that reads it, or build the buffer from data.

A pooled buffer goes back to the pool only from its device's own thread and
only while the device is alive. One destroyed on another thread, or after its
`Device`, frees its storage instead. That makes a pooled buffer exactly as safe
to outlive its device, or to die on another thread, as any other buffer: safe
on Metal, and not on D3D12 or Vulkan. There every buffer still refers to its
device's context, and freeing one goes through that context's deferred release
lists (`recycleDefaultBuffer` and `deferRelease` on D3D12,
`deferReleaseBuffer` on Vulkan), which are not locked. So on those two the
owning-thread rule still holds for destroying any buffer, pooled or not.

The command buffer is the unit of recycling, and that decides how long one
should be. A temporary destroyed while its command buffer is still being
recorded can only go back to work once that command buffer has run, so nothing
a buffer's own dispatches free is available to its later ones. A network's
layers recorded into one command buffer each get fresh storage for every
temporary; recorded a layer to a command buffer, layer n + 1 runs in layer
n's memory. On the Stable Audio SAME-L decoder that was the difference between
a 21.6 GB peak footprint and a 12.7 GB one, for identical output and a slightly
faster decode. Where the temporaries are large, submit at the boundary they
die at.

### Part of a buffer

A storage-buffer member takes a `BufferRange` as readily as a whole `Buffer`,
and so do `ComputePass::setInputBuffer` and `setOutputBuffer`. The kernel's
element zero is the element at the offset, so one allocation can be written a
row at a time:

```cpp
kernel.keys = BufferRange {&cache, rowBytes * step, rowBytes};
pass.dispatch(kernel, rowElements);     // writes cache[step], leaves the rest
```

The offset must be a multiple of `Device::storageBufferOffsetAlignment()` — four
on Metal and D3D12, which take any word-aligned offset, and the device's own
limit on Vulkan, where the offset goes into a descriptor (16 on Mesa's lavapipe,
up to 256 by the spec). So a row a kernel is bound over is rounded to that
rather than to the element size:

```cpp
const auto stride = Device::shared().storageBufferOffsetAlignment();
kernel.keys = BufferRange {&cache, row * stride, stride};
```

`range.bytes` is not enforced: what stops a kernel short is the count passed to
`dispatch`. A range that names no buffer, starts off that grid, or starts at or
past its buffer's end, binds nothing.

The render side takes a range wherever the compute side does:
`RenderPass::setVertexBuffer` and `drawIndexed` over the geometry, which want
only a word-aligned offset, and `setVertexStorageBuffer` and
`setFragmentStorageBuffer` over the buffer a stage subscripts, which want the
device's alignment like a kernel's slot — the latter being what a
`Uniform<InputBuffer>` on a `ShaderProgram` binds through. A draw handed an
unbindable index range draws nothing.

### Byte counts are 64-bit

Every byte count and offset on the buffer API is a `std::int64_t` —
`Buffer::size()`, the constructor's count, `read` and `update`, `BufferRange`'s
`offset` and `bytes`, `Device::makeBuffer`, `CommandBuffer::read`,
`ComputePass::setBytes` and the indirect-dispatch offset. A single buffer is
routinely past what an `int` holds: a language model's weight shard is
gigabytes, and a batch of logits reaches two of them at a few thousand rows, at
which point an `int` count wrapped silently and allocated something small and
negative instead of failing.

Signed rather than `std::size_t`, so a negative offset arriving from a caller's
own arithmetic stays negative and the guards that reject it keep working, and so
that mixing a count with the `int` element counts the rest of the API uses needs
no cast in either direction. Shader-side indexing is untouched and stays 32-bit:
what is wide is the host's description of the allocation, not the index a thread
computes.

Most call sites need no change — a `sizeof` or an `int` widens on its own. What
does need one is a count read back *out*: `int bytes = buffer.size();` narrows
where `auto` does not.

### A buffer over memory you already have

`Device::makeBufferOverMemory` takes an `ExternalMemory` — a pointer, a length
and a callback — and makes a buffer over those bytes rather than a copy of them:

```cpp
auto mapped = std::make_shared<MemoryMappedFile>(FilePath {weightsFile});

auto weights = device.makeBufferOverMemory(
    {const_cast<std::uint8_t*>(mapped->bytes().data()),
     (std::int64_t) mapped->size(),
     [mapped] {}},                       // holds the mapping open
    BufferUsage::Storage);

kernel.layer = BufferRange {&weights, tensor.offset, tensor.bytes};
```

That is what it is for: one mapping of a large file becomes one buffer, every
tensor in it a `BufferRange`, and the pages arrive from the page cache as the
GPU first touches them. The address must sit on `Buffer::memoryPageSize()`,
which a mapping of a whole file already does; the length may be anything, and
`size()` reports the count given rather than the page it is rounded up to
underneath. `Buffer::isPageAligned` answers the contract before the call, and a
descriptor that fails it makes an invalid `Buffer` rather than a quietly copied
one on every backend — so a call site written on one is one the others take.

Metal wires a no-copy buffer's pages the first time a command buffer uses it,
which for a nine-gigabyte checkpoint is half a second inside the first dispatch.
An adopted buffer asks for that at creation instead, through a residency set on
a background queue (macOS 15 and later), so it overlaps whatever the caller does
after loading, and reads the pages in on the way when the file is cold.

A request in flight holds a lock the next `newBufferWithBytesNoCopy` waits on,
so a loader that adopts a file as thirty 256 MB pieces and requests each at
once spends a second loading what is otherwise free. The requests are held
until nothing has been adopted for 10 ms (or the oldest has waited 100 ms) and
then sent one at a time, in the order the buffers were made. One at a time is
measured, not assumed: thirty requests side by side took 1.0 s for 7.5 GB where
one after another took 0.55 s, and slowed every CPU thread beside them.

`Buffer::canAdoptMemory(device)` says which of the two actually happened. True
on Metal, where a shared-storage `MTLBuffer` is built straight over the host
pages, so the caller and the GPU look at the same bytes in both directions and
nothing is copied; the callback then runs when the buffer is destroyed. False on
D3D12 and Vulkan, whose device heaps are not host memory: the same call copies,
and the callback runs as soon as the copy has been taken. Worth asking before
mapping a file the size of a model, since where it is false the bytes are paid
for twice.

### Writing a buffer the GPU may be reading

`Buffer::update` is ordered after everything submitted to the device before the
call, the same way `read` is: a kernel still writing those bytes has finished
before the host's arrive, and the host's are the ones that stay. The wait is
paid only where the write is a bare memcpy into memory the GPU can see — on
Metal, whose buffers are all shared storage, and on a host-mapped
`BufferStorage::Streaming` buffer anywhere. A device-storage write on D3D12 and
Vulkan is a copy recorded into the command stream, which the stream itself
orders, and waits for nothing.

**That wait is new**, and it is a cost every existing caller now pays: an update
that used to be a bare memcpy on Metal is a memcpy behind a wait for the newest
submission. Code that was already right by construction gets its old cost back
by asking for the unordered call by name — which is what `StreamingBuffers`,
`GPUWidgets`' coverage batch and the `Apps/GPU` samples in this tree were
changed to do, along with the `Apps/Plugins` demos.

`Buffer::updateUnordered` is that write with the wait given up, the caller
saying instead that no work the GPU still has in hand touches those bytes. There
are two ways to be able to say it. One is the frame loop: a renderer rewriting
its geometry every tick cannot stop in the middle of a frame to wait for the
newest submission — that is the CPU and the GPU taking turns rather than
overlapping — so it buys the ordering another way. `StreamingBuffers` is that
other way, and never hands out bytes from an arena a frame still in flight was
drawn from, which is why its own writes go through the unordered call. The other
is a caller that has ordered by hand and knows more than a `Buffer` can: it
waited on the command buffer that wrote those bytes, or read them back, or is a
step-by-step loop where the writer finished long ago and only a later, unrelated
submission is still running.

`CommandBuffer::update` is that second case with the wait built in and scoped to
one command buffer — `Buffer::update`'s sibling exactly as `CommandBuffer::read`
is `Buffer::read`'s. It waits for *this* command buffer and then writes, so a
loop keeping two in flight can overwrite step k's buffer without draining step
k+1:

```cpp
commands.submit();                             // step k
trailing.submit();                             // step k+1, still running

commands.update(state, patch.data(), bytes);   // waits for step k alone
```

Where the writer is known, that is the better call than either of the two on
`Buffer`.

### Buffers of integers

`Uniform<UIntInputBuffer>` and `Uniform<UIntOutputBuffer>` are the pair above
with `uint` elements: the subscript yields a `UInt` and `write` takes one.
Everything else is the same — the same slot counter, the same
`setInputBuffer`/`setOutputBuffer`, whole buffers or ranges alike — and both
backends declare them beside the float pair, `device const uint*` /
`device uint*` on Metal and `StructuredBuffer<uint>` /
`RWStructuredBuffer<uint>` on HLSL.

What they are for is data that is not a number to compute with: the token ids a
gather looks rows up by, the index an argmax arrived at, a count. A float
buffer carries those only as bits to cast, and only while they stay under 2^24.

They read and write records the way the float pair does: `read2`/`read3`/`read4`
yield a `UInt2`/`UInt3`/`UInt4`, `write` takes one, and the index counts records
on both sides.

```cpp
struct Gather final : ComputeProgram
{
    void define() override
    {
        auto i = threadId();
        write(rows, i, table[ids[i / width] * width + i % width]);
    }

    Uniform<UIntInputBuffer> ids;
    Uniform<InputBuffer> table;
    Uniform<OutputBuffer> rows;
    Uniform<UInt> width;
    EACP_SHADER(ids, table, rows, width)
};
```

One kernel's `UIntOutputBuffer` is the next one's `UIntInputBuffer` on the same
`GPU::Buffer`, so a decoder's ids go from the step that picked them to the step
that looks them up without reaching the CPU. A render stage reads one too, on
the terms below. There is no signed sibling: `Int` indexes constant arrays, and
a storage buffer of them has not been wanted.

### Atomics

`Uniform<AtomicBuffer>` is a storage buffer of **unsigned integers** every
thread may read-modify-write at once. `atomicAdd` adds to one element and gives
back what it held *before*, so threads that never meet come away with distinct
numbers — which is how a kernel hands out slots of a shared array:

```cpp
struct Bin final : ComputeProgram
{
    void define() override
    {
        auto id = threadId();
        auto slot = atomicAdd(counts, tileFor(id), 1u);

        ifThen(slot < capacity, [&] { write(items, slot, toFloat(id)); });
    }

    Uniform<AtomicBuffer> counts;   // uint elements
    Uniform<OutputBuffer> items;
    Uniform<UInt> capacity;
    EACP_SHADER(counts, items, capacity)
};
```

It is spelled as a statement, not an expression, and that is the two languages
rather than a choice: MSL's `atomic_fetch_add_explicit` returns the old value,
but HLSL's `InterlockedAdd` writes it through an out parameter and cannot appear
inside a larger expression. Naming the result is the only shape both can print.

The ordering is relaxed — the read-modify-write cannot be interleaved, and
nothing is said about how other memory either side of it is ordered. That is all
a counter needs; a kernel needing the second thing needs a barrier.

**The elements are integers.** The same `GPU::Buffer` bound to an `InputBuffer`
in a later kernel reads those bits as floats and yields nonsense. Bind it to a
`UIntInputBuffer` instead — which is how a later kernel reads what the counting
one left — or read it back with `counts.load(index)`. It binds like an output
otherwise, and takes a slot from the same counter.

### A dispatch the GPU sized

`dispatchIndirect` takes its threadgroup counts out of a buffer an earlier
kernel wrote, so a stage whose size depends on what the stage before it found
costs no readback — the number never reaches the CPU:

```cpp
{
    auto pass = commands.beginCompute();
    pass.dispatch(count, capacity);        // counts into `arguments`
}
{
    auto pass = commands.beginCompute();
    pass.dispatch(prepare, 1);             // count -> DispatchArguments
}
{
    auto pass = commands.beginCompute();
    pass.dispatchIndirect(consume, arguments, capacity);
}
```

`DispatchArguments` is the three **threadgroup** counts both backends read, at
the same size and in the same order. A kernel that counted 1000 items divides by
the group width the *consuming* kernel was compiled for — its
`groupShape().x`, 64 unless it asked for another — and writes
`(1000 + width - 1) / width`, not 1000. Writing them means writing integers, so
the buffer is a `Uniform<AtomicBuffer>` and `write(arguments, 0u, groups)` is
the store.

The last argument is what the generated bounds guard compares against, and it
cannot be the real count — nothing on the CPU knows it. Pass the **capacity**.
The guard then stops nothing short, and a kernel that must not run past the real
count reads it from a buffer and returns itself. Both guards matter: this one
keeps threads inside the allocation, the kernel's own keeps them inside the
data. The grid is rounded up to whole groups either way, so the tail of the last
group runs and has to be harmless.

The offset the arguments are read at — the last parameter, for a buffer holding
several grids — must be a multiple of four and leave a whole `DispatchArguments`
behind it. One that does not dispatches nothing.

Threads of one dispatch are ordered against each other by nothing but the end of
that dispatch, so a kernel reading what the previous one counted has to be a
later dispatch — a later pass, as above, or a later dispatch in the same one.

1D only. A 2D or 3D indirect dispatch would take its extents beside an offset
and could not be told apart from this one; nothing has needed it.

### Threadgroup memory

`shared<T>(count)` is memory one dispatch group has in common: every thread in
the group reads and writes it, no thread outside sees it, and it is gone when
the group is. `localId()` is what indexes it, and `barrier()` is what makes one
thread's writes visible to the rest:

```cpp
void define() override
{
    auto lane = localId();
    auto scratch = shared<Float>(groupShape().x);

    write(scratch, lane, input[threadId()]);
    barrier();

    // every thread now holds what the whole group fetched
    write(output, threadId(), scratch[lane ^ 1u]);
}
```

`groupShape()` is what to size the tile against rather than a literal, since it
follows the shape the kernel asked for — 64 for one that asked for nothing.

**How much there is to spend is a device question, and one the EDSL answers.**
`Device::maxThreadgroupMemory()` is the budget in bytes — Metal's
`maxThreadgroupMemoryLength`, a flat 32 KB at D3D's `cs_5_0`, Vulkan's
`maxComputeSharedMemorySize`, whose spec floor of 16 KB is therefore what a
kernel may assume anywhere. `ComputeProgram::threadgroupMemoryBytes()` is the
other half: what this kernel takes, its `shared<>` arrays plus the scratch the
emitter adds behind them for a reduction and for a SIMD-group matrix, counted as
the worst of the three backends since a kernel is written once.
`fitsThreadgroupMemory(device)` is the two compared, and `prepare()` names an
overspend in the log — both numbers — before the backend reports it as a
pipeline that would not build, which on Metal happens after the library compiled
clean and points at the wrong thing.

Nothing initialises it — what it holds before the group writes it is undefined,
which is why every use starts by filling it and waiting. Reading is a subscript;
writing goes through the same `write()` the buffers and textures use, because a
write is a statement and has to land where it was written.

**A barrier must be reached by every thread in the group or by none.** One
inside an `ifThen` that some threads take and others do not is undefined in both
languages, and undefined here means a hang rather than a wrong answer. Diverging
*after* a barrier is ordinary control flow; diverging *around* one is not.

That rule reaches the dispatch too: a kernel that barriers gets **no** early
bounds guard, since a barrier below a return some threads took is exactly the
divergence the rule forbids. Every thread of every group therefore runs the
whole body, and the dispatch rounds the grid up to whole groups — so the tail of
the last group runs on indices past the data, and the kernel has to hold its own
stores, typically with `ifThen(id < gridCount(), ...)`. Size the grid in
multiples of `groupShape()` where the tail would otherwise compute nonsense, and
guard the writes either way.

The declaration is the one place the two backends are not the same shape twice:
MSL's `threadgroup` is a local of the kernel function, HLSL's `groupshared` is a
global, so the same array lands on opposite sides of the entry point.

A buffer whose elements are records rather than single floats is read and
written a record at a time. `read2`/`read3`/`read4` take N consecutive floats
starting at `index * N`, and `write` has the matching `Float2`/`Float3`/`Float4`
overloads — the index is in records on both sides, so a kernel over a struct of
four floats never spells the stride:

```cpp
auto particle = state.read4(index);           // position.xy, velocity.xy
write(next, index, float4(newPosition, newVelocity));
```

Underneath, the `write` overloads are N scalar accesses over a buffer that is
still a run of floats. `write2`/`write3`/`write4` lay the same bytes down as
**one** store, at the same record index:

```cpp
write4(next, index, float4(newPosition, newVelocity));   // one store on Metal
```

The two coexist because the wide store is not the trade it was once taken for.
It does not retype the binding — it reinterprets the *address being written*,
which is the same pointer cast `read4` makes at the address being read — so an
output written wide is still a run of floats, still bindable as a per-instance
vertex stream with no CPU-side element size to agree on. The alignment contract
is `read4`'s too: the pointer is a `packed_float4`, wanting four-byte alignment
and not sixteen, so any offset `Device::storageBufferOffsetAlignment()` lets a
`BufferRange` start at is one a wide store can write to. On HLSL and GLSL, which
have nothing to reinterpret, `write4` prints the four subscripts `write` already
prints — over a value named once first, so the whole record is evaluated before
any part of it reaches memory and `write4(out, i, f(out.read4(i)))` means what it
says.

The *read* of a read-only buffer is one load where the dialect has a spelling
for one. On Metal `input.read4(i)` is the sixteen bytes fetched through a
`packed_float4` pointer — packed and not `float4`, because a ranged bind's
offset only has to sit on `Device::storageBufferOffsetAlignment()`, which is
four bytes there, and a `float4` load wants sixteen. HLSL and GLSL have nothing
to reinterpret — a `StructuredBuffer<float>` and an std430 block of floats are
runs of scalars — so they emit exactly the componentwise construct, with the
base index named once. Giving them a real vector load would mean changing the
binding itself: a raw `ByteAddressBuffer` SRV on D3D12, with every scalar read
respelled as `asfloat(buffer0.Load(i * 4))`, or a second block aliasing the same
binding in GLSL. Neither is worth what it would cost the scalar path, which is
what almost every kernel reads through.

`OutputBuffer`'s vector reads stay scalar on every backend, and that is not an
oversight: an output may hold what this very thread stored into it a statement
ago, and the subscript through the pointer that was written is what orders the
two. A load through a second pointer of another type has nothing saying it may
not be hoisted above the store.

A record read is one write above its stores all the same — every component is
stored the value the record held before the first of them ran — so a record read
out of an output and rearranged back into it swaps its components rather than
broadcasting one:

```cpp
auto pair = output.read2(i);
write(output, i, float2(pair.y(), pair.x()));
```

Every read takes an unsigned literal as well as a computed index — `input[0]`,
`input.read4(0u)` — so the one element a whole dispatch broadcasts from needs no
`var()` to carry its index, the same courtesy `AtomicBuffer::load` extends to a
shared counter.

**An output is readable too.** `output[i]` and its `read2`/`read3`/`read4` are
the subscript the store already is: both backends declare an output writable
(`device float*` on Metal, `RWStructuredBuffer<float>` on HLSL), so nothing new
is bound and nothing new is declared. A softmax is the case that asks for it —
normalising wants the exponentials the kernel just wrote, not `exp()` evaluated a
second time:

```cpp
write(output, i, exp(input[i] - peak));
write(output, i, output[i] / total);
```

What that promises is read-after-write **within one thread**, in the order the
statements were written. Another thread's store is visible only once the dispatch
has ended, exactly as it is for the count `AtomicBuffer::load` hands back.

A resource member holds a pointer, so it takes a named buffer or texture and
refuses a temporary outright: `kernel.input = device.makeBuffer(...)` would point
into something destroyed at the semicolon, and it is a compile error rather than
a wrong picture.

A command buffer has one open encoder at a time, so let a pass end before
beginning the next one — which is a rule about encoders and not about
visibility, since a dispatch already sees what an earlier dispatch in the same
pass wrote. `Apps/GPU/ComputeParticles` is the worked example, and
`Apps/GPU/AsyncCompute` times the two commits against each other.

A `write()` happens **where it is written**: one inside an `ifThen` runs only
when the condition holds, and one inside a `loop` runs every iteration. That is
worth stating because it was not always true — stores used to be collected and
emitted after the body, so a guarded write ran unconditionally and a looped one
ran once afterwards on the counter's final value. Both compiled and neither
complained; `Tests/GPU/StorePlacementTests.cpp` is what now says otherwise.

### What the graph shares, and what it will not move

Two calls that build the same value get the same node, so the emitter prints it
once and names it. Three kinds take that: **constants**, **pure binaries** — the
write's `gid * 4u` and the read's are one node — and **reads of read-only
buffers**. That last one is what makes two `readHalf(scale, i)` calls at one
index a single load rather than two, however far apart in a kernel they were
written, and it is what a hand-unrolled inner loop that fetches the same scale
per lane depends on.

An **output's** reads are never shared, and that is not an omission. An output
may hold what this very thread stored a statement ago — the whole point of
`output[i]` — so two reads of one element with a store between them are two
different values and stay two loads. The slot's declared access is what decides:
an `InputBuffer` cannot be stored to by anything the EDSL can express, so what
its elements hold is fixed for the dispatch.

Which is why **one `GPU::Buffer` must not be bound to an input slot and an
output slot of the same kernel** — a rule `InputBuffer` already states, and one
this sharing now has teeth behind: the emitter orders a read against the stores
to *its slot*, so two reads of an input either side of a store through an output
slot that happens to name the same buffer are merged into one load above that
store. A kernel that computes in place declares one `OutputBuffer` and reads it.

Sharing a node is **not** licence to move it. A node's name is handed out where
the statement being emitted evaluates it anyway, so a read used only inside a
`loop` body or an `ifThen` is named inside that body and issued there — a
loop-invariant read written inside a loop stays inside it, and a read written
under a guard stays under the guard. And a read subscripted by a mutable local
is not shared at all: the index is a `var()` read, which makes the read impure,
which is what keeps a row walk from collapsing into one load of the counter's
first value. `Tests/GPU/HoistingTests.cpp` pins all four of these.

### A handle is a value

`auto p = f(x);` means what it means in C++: `f` is evaluated once, where the
line is, and `p` is that value however often it is used and whatever runs
after it. The in-place softmax a row pass is shows why that matters:

```cpp
auto probability = exp(scores[index] - peak);

write(scores, index, probability);
total += probability;
```

The sum adds the probability — the same one the store wrote — and `exp` runs
once. A graph is a tree of expressions rather than of statements, though, and
an expression printed at each use is evaluated at each use: printed into the
sum, `scores[index]` would be read *after* the store and the sum would add
`exp` of the probability.

So the emitter orders a handle against the statements around it. Every node
remembers where among the statements it was built; ahead of each statement that
writes something — a variable, a buffer element, threadgroup memory, which
includes a barrier — every expression built before it that reads what it
writes, and that the statement or anything after it still evaluates, is named
there: evaluated once, before the write, and read back by name afterwards. The
same holds for a variable (`auto scaled = input[i] * scale; scale += 1.0f;` —
`scaled` keeps the old factor) and for a tile behind a barrier (a handle read
before it is what the tile held there; read the tile again after the barrier to
see what the other threads published).

The rule names the **outermost** stale expression — `exp(scores[index] - peak)`
rather than `scores[index]` — so nothing is evaluated twice, and it names
nothing that no write stands between. That is the trade-off it was chosen over
the simpler one, naming every expression bound to a C++ variable: the graph
cannot see a C++ variable (a handle is a node id, and a temporary is the same
thing), and naming every subexpression would put a register on every
intermediate a compiler would otherwise fuse. As it is, a kernel that never
reads what it writes emits exactly the source it did before this rule existed,
and one that does holds one value across the write rather than evaluating it
again after it — one live register traded for the recomputation.

The one handle that is not a value is a **loop's condition**. It is re-tested
before every iteration by construction, so what it reads, and everything built
on those reads, is evaluated where it is used — `limit = reach + 8u` tested in
`loop(i < limit, ...)` over a body that raises `reach` sees the raised bound.
`Tests/GPU/HoistingTests.cpp` and `GPU/codegenAnInPlaceExpIsEvaluatedOnce`
pin both sides.

### Reducing over the group

`groupSum`, `groupMax` and `groupMin` are the fold a shared tile was being
hand-written for. Every thread of the group contributes a value, and every
thread gets the reduction over the whole group back — not a partial, and not
only the leader:

```cpp
void define() override
{
    auto i = threadId();
    auto x = input[i];

    auto mean = groupSum(x) / width;
    auto centred = x - mean;
    auto variance = groupSum(centred * centred) / width;

    write(output, i, centred * rsqrt(variance + 1.0e-5f));
}
```

They take a `Float` or a `UInt`, they may be called as many times as a kernel
needs, and the result is an ordinary value: divide it, feed it to the next one,
carry it into a loop or a store.

**Like a barrier, a reduction must be reached by every thread in the group or
by none** — it *is* a barrier, several of them on some backends, so one inside
an `ifThen` that only some threads take hangs rather than answering wrongly.
And for the same reason a kernel that reduces loses its early-return bounds
guard, exactly as one that barriers does: dispatch it over a whole number of
groups and guard the stores against `gridCount()` yourself.

A 1D, a 2D and a 3D kernel all reduce over the *whole* group — 64 threads, an
8×8 tile and a 4×4×4 block are one group each and fold to one number — rather
than over a row or a plane of it.

What each backend emits is the fastest form it has. Metal reduces within each
SIMD group with `simd_sum`/`simd_max`/`simd_min` and combines those few
partials through a scratch array; HLSL under FXC has no wave intrinsic at
`cs_5_0` and GLSL is held to what a driver compiles with no subgroup extension,
so both walk a `groupshared` tree with a barrier per halving step. The scratch
is the emitter's own, declared once per kernel and only where a reduction asked
for it — and on Metal only where a *whole-group* fold asked, since a SIMD-scoped
one needs none.

A group of `simdWidth` threads is not a special case of that: whether it is one
SIMD group is a property of the compiled pipeline
(`ComputePipeline::threadExecutionWidth`) and not of the EDSL, and an Intel Mac
runs a kernel at eight or sixteen lanes. The wide fold therefore keeps its
combine at every group size — `simdCount` is whatever the hardware gave — which
is what it was always for.

**`simdSum`, `simdMax` and `simdMin` are the same three narrowed to one SIMD
group.** Every thread is handed the fold of the `simdWidth` threads it shares a
SIMD group with, so a group of several comes out holding one answer per SIMD
group rather than one for the group. That is what a fold inside a per-tile loop
wants — attention walking its keys a SIMD group at a time has nothing to say to
the rest of the threadgroup yet — and on Metal it is a single instruction with
no threadgroup memory and no barrier, against the two barriers the wide fold
costs.

They are still collective, and the rule is the wide fold's: every thread of the
*threadgroup* reaches one or none does, and a kernel holding one loses its
bounds guard. That is because the other two backends still reach it through the
scratch, narrowed to the folding thread's own block of lanes — HLSL has no wave
intrinsic at `cs_5_0`, and GLSL's `subgroupAdd` is both an extension no lane
here is held to and the wrong fold: a subgroup is whatever width the device says
it is (eight on Mesa's lavapipe), where `simdWidth` is thirty-two everywhere by
construction, exactly as the SIMD-group matrix fixes it. An intrinsic that folded
a different number of threads under the same name would be worse than no
intrinsic. The group has to be a whole number of SIMD groups, or narrower than
one — the same rule a fragment is under, with the one allowance that a group
smaller than a SIMD group *is* its own SIMD group.

**How many threads one folds is the one promise these three cannot keep on
their own.** The emulated backends fold exactly `simdWidth` lanes, because that
is what the emitted tree walks. Metal folds the *hardware* SIMD group, which is
what `simd_sum` is collective over — thirty-two on every Apple GPU, eight or
sixteen on an Intel one, where the same call folds a quarter of what the
arithmetic around it assumes. eacp needs the two to agree and cannot know until
there is a pipeline, so `ComputeProgram::prepare` compares the compiled kernel's
`threadExecutionWidth` against `simdWidth` and says so in the log when they
differ — for a kernel using `simdSum`/`simdMax`/`simdMin` or a `SimdMatrix`.
A kernel that has to be right at any width wants `groupSum`/`groupMax`/
`groupMin` instead.

**Uniform control flow, not merely a uniform arrival.** Every thread must reach
a fold with the same branches taken. `loop(condition, body)` takes an ordinary
per-thread `Bool`, so a fold inside a loop some lanes leave earlier than others
is divergent: the emulated backends hang at the barrier inside the fold, and
Metal's intrinsic tolerates it silently and folds only the lanes still running —
which is the worse of the two, being right on the machine it was written on and
a hang on the next. Bound the loop by something uniform across the group and
guard the body's stores instead.

### The SIMD-group matrix

`SimdMatrix` is an 8×8 patch of a float matrix held between the registers of a
whole SIMD group rather than by any one thread, and `multiplyAccumulate` is the
product of two of them added into a third. It is the primitive a blocked matrix
product is written out of, and on Metal it is one instruction:

```cpp
struct Product final : ComputeProgram
{
    // 256 threads, so eight SIMD groups; each owns a 32 x 16 block of a
    // 64 x 64 tile of C as eight accumulator fragments.
    Product() : ComputeProgram({256, 1, 1}) { compile(); }

    void define() override
    {
        auto tile = shared<Float>(64 * 32 + 32 * 64);
        auto simd = simdGroupIndex();

        auto rowOffset = (simd % 2u) * 32u;
        auto columnOffset = (simd / 2u) * 16u;

        SimdMatrix accumulators[8];

        for (auto& accumulator: accumulators)
            accumulator = simdMatrix();          // a fragment of zeroes

        // ... stage a 64 x 32 slab of A and a 32 x 64 slab of B into `tile`,
        // then barrier() ...

        auto left = simdMatrix(tile, rowOffset * 32u, unsignedInteger(32u));
        auto right = simdMatrix(tile, 2048u + columnOffset, unsignedInteger(64u));

        multiplyAccumulate(accumulators[0], left, right);

        // ... and back out through the same tile, or straight to the buffer
        write(output, at, cRowStride, accumulators[0]);
    }
};
```

Eight calls, and they are the whole vocabulary:

| call | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `simdGroupIndex()` | which SIMD group of the threadgroup this thread is in, numbered from the flat local index. What places the block of the output a SIMD group owns |
| `simdMatrix(fill)` | a fragment every element of which is that value — the zero an accumulator starts from. `fill` is a literal, not an expression |
| `simdMatrix(tile, offset, rowStride)` | a fragment read from an 8×8 patch of a threadgroup array: element (r, c) at `offset + r * rowStride + c` |
| `simdMatrix(buffer, offset, rowStride)` | the same out of a storage buffer, input or output |
| `simdMatrixHalf(buffer, offset, rowStride)` | a fragment read straight out of a buffer of packed fp16, the offset and the stride counting in halves. An operand only |
| `simdMatrixBFloat16(buffer, offset, rowStride)` | the same for packed bf16 |
| `multiplyAccumulate(acc, left, right)` | `acc += left * right`, over the three fragments |
| `write(buffer, offset, rowStride, fragment)` | the patch written back, addressed the way the load addresses one. `write(tile, ...)` is its threadgroup sibling |

`ComputeProgram::simdWidth` is how many threads a SIMD group holds and
`simdMatrixWidth` the side of a fragment — 32 and 8. Both are constants of the
EDSL rather than of the device: Metal's own are the same numbers, and the
backends that emit the fallback below define theirs to match, so a kernel's
tiling arithmetic is one arithmetic everywhere.

What that costs is four rules, all of them the shape a SIMD-group intrinsic
already has:

- **A fragment is loaded and stored whole.** There is no element of one to
  subscript and no per-element guard to put on one, so the 8×8 patch has to be
  inside the array. A tile hanging off the edge of a ragged shape goes back
  through threadgroup memory and is copied out element by element — which costs
  nothing measurable, since the copy is once per tile against a slab loop.
- **The offset and the stride are the same on every lane.** They address one
  patch for the group, not one per lane. A value derived from `localId()` is
  not one of those; `simdGroupIndex()` and `groupPosition()` are.
- **Every thread of the group reaches every operation on one**, the way it
  reaches a barrier. A kernel holding a fragment therefore loses its
  early-return bounds guard exactly as one that barriers does, and bounds its
  own stores.
- **The threadgroup has to be a whole number of SIMD groups** — a multiple of
  `simdWidth` threads. The stock 64 and 8×8 are; a shape named by
  `ComputeProgram({...})` is asserted on.

**Metal is the fast path and the other two are correctness.** MSL has
`simdgroup_float8x8` and the three intrinsics, so each call above is one line of
emitted source. HLSL at `cs_5_0` under FXC has no wave matrix operation and
neither does GLSL without an extension no lane here is held to, so both spread
a fragment over the 32 lanes of what would have been the SIMD group the way
Metal does: lane *l* holds the pair of elements at row *l* / 4, columns
(*l* % 4) × 2 and the next, as two floats of its own. The fill, the load and the
store are that pair moved, every lane its own, so no store needs a lane picked
to make it. The product is the one operation that needs what other lanes hold:
it stages both operands whole in a `groupshared` scratch of the emitter's own,
one slice per SIMD group, and between two barriers each lane takes its row of
the left against its two columns of the right — the exchange a wave intrinsic
makes in registers, made through threadgroup memory instead. That is why the
third rule above is a barrier's rule: on these two backends every product
holds one. The price is those barriers and the staging, and it is a price
worth naming: a kernel whose throughput matters on Windows or Linux wants the
register-tiled form beside this one, not this one.

The fallback was first written the other way round, the whole 64 floats in
every thread and the product computed 32 times over, and it fell to a limit
FXC keeps that no other compiler here does: every per-thread array counts
against one budget of 4096 registers for the kernel, and the blocked product
below, holding a few dozen fragments at once, went past it — `error X4505`
after seconds of compiling, on every Windows lane. Two floats a fragment is
what keeps a kernel of any reasonable width under that budget.

`Tests/GPU/SimdMatrixTests.cpp` holds the worked blocked product — a 64×64 tile,
a 32-deep slab, clamped loads and a guarded copy-out — checked against a scalar
reference on whole tiles, on a ragged shape and at a transformer's own
[1500, 384] × [384, 1536].

#### Tiling a product that is fast

`ML::LinearF32` is the product above grown up, and what moved it is worth
knowing before writing another. On an M5 Max, measured on a transformer's own
shapes ([339, 1536] against weights up to [12288, 1536]), each of these was
kept only because it was measurably faster, and none of them changes a single
bit of the result:

- **Pad threadgroup rows by eight floats.** A fragment load reads eight rows
  of eight. At a row stride that is a multiple of the 32 banks — a 32-deep slab,
  a 64-wide tile — all eight rows land on the same eight banks; a stride eight
  floats longer puts each row on the next eight, so the load takes the two
  passes its 64 floats need and no more.
- **A shallower slab.** 16 deep in k beats 32 and 8. It is more barriers for
  the same products, but less threadgroup memory, and more threadgroups
  resident on a core hide the global reads better than a deeper slab amortises
  its barriers.
- **Four-wide reads, the next slab's issued before this slab's products**, and
  a 32 × 32 block per SIMD group so each fragment loaded feeds four products.
- **Fragments stored straight to the buffer** wherever one lies wholly inside
  the output, with only the ragged edge going back through threadgroup memory.

Together that is 18% on those shapes: from 5.5 to 6.7 TFLOPS, against 14.4 for
the SIMD-group product on its own with nothing to load, so there is headroom
left for whoever comes next. The result stays bit for bit what it was because
none of it touches the one thing that decides a sum's rounding: every output
element is still the same sequence of 8 × 8 × 8 products, k in steps of eight
from zero, into an accumulator that starts at zero. Which SIMD group computes
an element, how the operands reached threadgroup memory and how deep a slab is
do not enter into it.

The tile's height is then a question about the batch, not the hardware. The
last row of tiles computes every row it holds whether the batch has it or not,
and a transformer's batch is whatever the sequence is: the DiT's 387 rows are
six tiles of 64 and a seventh holding three, so 448 rows are computed for 387.
Tiles of 32 compute 416. `linearTileRowsFor` picks whichever pads the batch to
fewer rows, and 64 on a tie, since 32 × 32 blocks reuse a loaded fragment more
than the 32 × 16 blocks a 32-row tile splits into. Both keep four SIMD groups
and the same slab, so the choice is one constructor argument and the bits do
not move (`Linear/tilingsGiveTheSameBits`). On the DiT's five shapes that is
8–25% on `LinearF32` alone, most on the narrowest outputs (1536 columns),
which have the fewest threadgroups to spread over 40 cores and gain from
having twice as many; at 384 rows, where 64 wastes nothing, the two tilings
measure the same.

#### A weight read where it lies

A checkpoint ships its weights in sixteen bits, and the product above wants
floats, so a tiled kernel widens a tile of them into threadgroup memory before
it can load a fragment: twice the memory the weights occupy, and two barriers
around the staging. `simdMatrixHalf` and `simdMatrixBFloat16` remove all three.
They read the 8×8 patch out of the packed buffer directly, and the offset and
the row stride count in those sixteen-bit elements — a bf16 weight matrix's row
stride is the number of columns it has, not half of it, which is the convention
`readHalf` and `readBFloat16` already set. The buffer is an ordinary
`InputBuffer`; what is packed is its contents, not its declared type.

On Metal the patch becomes a `simdgroup_half8x8` or a `simdgroup_bfloat8x8`,
loaded through the buffer's pointer reinterpreted, and it stays that type
through the product: MSL's `simdgroup_multiply_accumulate` takes mixed operands
into a float accumulator, so there is no widening step between the load and the
multiply. That is what makes it free — a staged activation against a packed
weight is one instruction.

```cpp
auto accumulator = simdMatrix();
auto activations = simdMatrix(tile, tileOffset, slabStride);
auto weights = simdMatrixBFloat16(weightBuffer, row * columns, columns);

multiplyAccumulate(accumulator, activations, weights);
```

A packed fragment is an **operand and nothing else**. It cannot be an
accumulator — sixteen bits would lose what the sum is being accumulated in —
and it cannot be written back, there being no instruction that stores one.
Both are asserts, not compile errors the shader compiler reports.

**The native path is Metal's alone.** `simdgroup_half8x8` is Metal 2.3 and lands
on the macOS 11 floor eacp builds against; `simdgroup_bfloat8x8` is Metal 3.1
and needs macOS 14 or iOS 17. So there are two queries and not one:

```cpp
if (Device::shared().supportsBFloat16SimdMatrix())
    // build the kernel that loads the weight packed
else
    // build the kernel that stages it into a shared<Float> tile
```

Both are false on D3D12 and Vulkan, which have no wave matrix operation to
lower to. **Both calls still build there and still compute the right thing**:
a packed load becomes each lane widening the two elements it holds, through the
same helper a scalar `readBFloat16` goes through, and the fragment is the float
pair the fallback always was. What the query answers is whether the load is
*native* — one instruction, nothing widened — and so whether it is worth
shaping a kernel around. It is not the question of whether the kernel compiles.

Those are two questions and eacp keeps them apart.
`ComputeProgram::fitsPackedSimdMatrix` is the second one, and it is false only
where the shader would genuinely not compile: on Metal, when the device says
no. On the other two backends it is true regardless.

The choice belongs **outside** the kernel, at the point where it is built, and
never inside one as a branch. The staging path carries barriers that the packed
path does not, and a barrier some threads in a group reach and others do not is
undefined — the two cannot be the arms of one `if`. A Metal kernel built
against the wrong answer is refused by `ComputeProgram::prepare()`, which names
the query and leaves an invalid pipeline, rather than handed to a shader
compiler that would complain about a type instead. A refused program reports
`ComputeProgram::isValid() == false`, and dispatching one is a no-op rather than
a crash — `ComputePass` drops a dispatch whose pipeline never bound.

`EACP_NO_PACKED_SIMD_MATRIX=1` makes both queries answer no on a device that
would have said yes. It is how the staged path stays exercised on hardware that
never takes it, and how a kernel's two shapes can be run against each other on
one machine.

**The float operand is not narrowed** — measured, not promised. A mixed
`simdgroup_multiply_accumulate` could in principle bring both operands to the
packed one's format before multiplying, which would quietly cost the
*activation* eight significand bits and give back more than the staging ever
saved. On an M5 Max under macOS 26 it does not: a left operand of 1 + 2⁻¹²
against eight packed ones accumulates to 8.001953125, where narrowing would
have given a flat 8. `Tests/GPU/SimdMatrixTests.cpp` asserts this for both
formats, so a device or a driver that behaves otherwise fails the suite rather
than silently losing precision. It is a measurement on the hardware to hand and
nothing in the Metal specification requires it, so treat a new part as unmeasured
until the suite has run on it.

### Textures a kernel writes

The other thing a kernel produces is an image, and it reaches the fragment stage
with no new machinery at all: once a `Texture` is written by a kernel, the
`setFragmentTexture` that was always there samples it in a later pass on the
same frame.

A texture opts in the way a render target does, and only in a format a typed
store is guaranteed for — `RGBA8Unorm`, `RGBA16Float`, `RGBA32Float`. Notably
**not** `BGRA8Unorm`, the drawable's own format and the first one most people
reach for; asking for it yields an invalid texture rather than a kernel whose
writes go nowhere.

```cpp
auto descriptor = TextureDescriptor {};
descriptor.width = 512;
descriptor.height = 512;
descriptor.format = TextureFormat::RGBA8Unorm;
descriptor.computeWrite = true;

struct PaintPlasma final : ComputeProgram
{
    void define() override
    {
        auto p = threadPosition();
        write(target, p.x, p.y, float4(colourAt(p), 1.f));
    }

    Uniform<WritableTexture2D> target;      // bound as the kernel's output
    Uniform<Texture2D> source;              // sampled or fetched, if it needs one
    EACP_SHADER(target, source)
};
```

Read and written textures take slots from one counter — Metal binds both to one
texture index space — so a kernel reading one and writing another gives them
distinct indices. `Apps/GPU/ComputeImage` is the worked example: a kernel paints
a 512×512 texture every frame and the next pass samples it full-screen.

### Buffers a shader stage reads

The third way a kernel's output reaches a draw. `setInstanceBuffer` hands the
vertex stage one record per instance and a written texture hands the fragment
stage an image; a `Uniform<InputBuffer>` on a `ShaderProgram` hands either stage
the buffer *itself*, to subscript at an index it worked out:

```cpp
struct DrawFromPalette final : ShaderProgram
{
    void define() override
    {
        auto position = vertexInput(&Vertex::position);

        setPosition(float4(position, 0.f, 1.f));
        setFragment(float4(palette.read3(record), 1.f));
    }

    Uniform<InputBuffer> palette;   // bound whole, read by index
    Uniform<UInt> record;
    EACP_SHADER(palette, record)
};

draw.palette = computed;            // the buffer a kernel filled
draw.record = 3;
pass.draw(draw);                    // binds it to both stages
```

The same `InputBuffer` a kernel declares, and the same `read2`/`read3`/`read4`
record reads — what differs is only that no store makes the graph a kernel, so
it emits a vertex/fragment pair. A `Uniform<UIntInputBuffer>` reads here on the
same terms. Read-only either way: writing stays the compute path's job. Each
stage declares only the buffers its own expressions read, and the program binds
to both, so a buffer works wherever `define()` reaches for it.

A `BufferRange` binds here as it does on a kernel: `draw.palette = BufferRange
{&computed, rowBytes * row, rowBytes}` makes the shader's element zero the
element at the offset, under the rules in *Part of a buffer*.

Reach for this when the thing being read is not an image and does not line up one
record per instance — a lookup table, a record picked by an id the shader
computed. When it *is* one record per instance, `instanceInput` is still the
idiomatic path.

### fp16 weights, kept packed

There is no `Half` value type and there is not going to be one: the Windows
backend compiles HLSL through FXC at `cs_5_0`, where `half` is a synonym for
`float` and there is no 16-bit arithmetic at all, so the same declaration would
mean two different things on the two backends. What *is* portable, and what a
model's weights actually want, is fp16 **storage** with fp32 arithmetic — half
the buffer, half the bandwidth, and every value widened before it is used:

```cpp
void define() override
{
    auto i = threadId();
    write(output, i, weights.readHalf(i) * input[i]);   // fp16 in, fp32 maths
}
```

A float storage buffer is a run of floats on both backends, so a packed word
arrives as a float whose value is meaningless and whose bits are the payload.
These are the way in and out of that:

| call | what it gives |
| --- | --- |
| `input.readHalf(i)` | element `i` of a buffer of halves, widened to a `Float`. `i` counts halves, so an N-weight buffer is walked `0..N-1` |
| `input.readHalf2(i)` | both halves of word `i` as a `Float2`, `.x` the low bits |
| `input.readHalf4(i)` | four halves as a `Float4` — the two words starting at word `2 * i`, so `i` counts records of four and element `k` is `readHalf4(k / 4)` component `k % 4` |
| `unpackHalf2(bits)` | the same, from a `UInt` already in hand |
| `packHalf2(pair)` | two floats narrowed and packed into a `UInt` |
| `writeHalf2(out, i, pair)` | that word stored at `i` — `readHalf2` reads it back |
| `writeHalf4(out, i, quad)` | four halves narrowed into two words and laid down in one store at the index `readHalf4` counts in |
| `asUInt(f)` / `asFloat(u)` | a value's bits rather than its value, both ways — componentwise over a `Float2/3/4` and a `UInt2/3/4` as well as over the scalars |

Size the buffer in whole words: `readHalf` fetches the word at `i / 2`, so an
odd count of halves reads past its last byte on the final element. `readHalf4`
and `readBFloat16x4` want a whole number of *pairs* of words for the same
reason.

The four-wide pair is the width a weight walk wants, and it is not four
subscripts: both take their two words through `read2`, so on Metal the eight
bytes arrive in one `packed_float2` load and the unpacking is register
arithmetic over what came back. HLSL and GLSL fetch the two words as two
scalars, which is what their float buffers give — see the vector reads above
for why neither can reinterpret one.

`readHalf` emits a two-argument helper — the word and which half of it — rather
than unpacking both and selecting: MSL and HLSL each reach the wanted half with
a single shift. `unpackHalf2` and `packHalf2` are helpers for the reason
`callName` cannot serve them, MSL bitcasting a `half2` where HLSL calls
`f16tof32`/`f32tof16` against a shift. Only the helpers a graph calls are
emitted into it.

Widening is exact on both backends, subnormals and infinities included, and so
is a round trip through `packHalf2` of anything fp16 can hold. **Narrowing a
value it cannot hold is the one place they differ**, alongside `round()`: Metal
converts per IEEE — nearest-even, and a finite magnitude past 65504 becomes an
infinity — while D3D specifies round-to-zero and saturates that magnitude to the
largest finite half instead. Round before narrowing if the answer has to be the
same on both.

### bf16 weights, kept packed

The same storage trick for the other 16-bit float, which is what a modern
checkpoint actually ships — Gemma, Llama and Mistral are all bf16 on disk.
bfloat16 is fp32 with the low sixteen mantissa bits dropped: eight exponent
bits against fp16's five, and seven mantissa bits against ten. The family
mirrors the fp16 one call for call:

```cpp
void define() override
{
    auto i = threadId();
    write(output, i, weights.readBFloat16(i) * input[i]);  // bf16 in, fp32 out
}
```

| call | what it gives |
| --- | --- |
| `input.readBFloat16(i)` | element `i` of a buffer of bfloat16s, widened to a `Float`. `i` counts bfloat16s |
| `input.readBFloat16x2(i)` | both bfloat16s of word `i` as a `Float2`, `.x` the low bits |
| `input.readBFloat16x4(i)` | four bfloat16s as a `Float4` — the two words starting at word `2 * i`, on the terms `readHalf4` sets |
| `unpackBFloat16x2(bits)` | the same, from a `UInt` already in hand |
| `packBFloat16x2(pair)` | two floats narrowed and packed into a `UInt` |
| `writeBFloat16x2(out, i, pair)` | that word stored at `i` — `readBFloat16x2` reads it back |
| `writeBFloat16x4(out, i, quad)` | four bfloat16s narrowed into two words and laid down in one store at the index `readBFloat16x4` counts in |

**Do not reach a bf16 weight through the fp16 path.** The two are not
interchangeable storage: with five exponent bits, fp16 flushes 1e-6 to a
subnormal and takes 1e30 to infinity, both of which are ordinary bf16 values.
A checkpoint routed through `readHalf` is not less precise, it is wrong.

Widening is a shift and a bitcast — the sixteen bits back at the top of a word,
nothing to rebias and no subnormal case — so it is exact and **bit-identical on
every backend**, which the fp16 widening is too. Unlike `packHalf2`, the
narrowing is bit-identical as well: no dialect has a bf16 instruction to hand
the rounding to, so `packBFloat16x2` does round-to-nearest-even in integer
arithmetic itself, and every backend emits the same arithmetic. A NaN is
quieted rather than rounded, so it cannot carry into the exponent and come back
as an infinity. `bfloat16FromFloat` / `bfloat16ToFloat` in `PackedVertex.h` are
the host side of the same encoding, for filling a buffer or checking one.

### int8 and int4 weights, kept packed

The same storage trick again, for weights that are not floats at all. A
block-quantized checkpoint stores a run of small integers and one scale per
block, so what a read owes is the **integer, exactly** — the scale is a multiply
the kernel does, since which scale belongs to which run is the format's business
and not a buffer read's:

```cpp
void define() override
{
    auto i = threadId();
    auto block = i / 32u;

    write(output, i, weights.readInt8(i) * scales[block]);  // int8 in, fp32 out
}
```

| call | what it gives |
| --- | --- |
| `input.readInt8(i)` / `readUInt8(i)` | element `i` of a buffer of bytes, widened to a `Float`. `i` counts bytes, so an N-weight buffer is walked `0..N-1` |
| `input.readInt8x4(i)` / `readUInt8x4(i)` | all four bytes of word `i` as a `Float4`, `.x` the low eight bits. `i` counts words, and element `k` is `readInt8x4(k / 4)` component `k % 4` |
| `input.readInt8x8(i)` / `readUInt8x8(i)` | eight bytes as a `Float4Pair`, one eight-byte load. `i` counts records of eight |
| `input.readInt8x16(i)` / `readUInt8x16(i)` | sixteen bytes as a `Float4Quad` — `.a .b .c .d` in address order, one sixteen-byte load. `i` counts records of sixteen |
| `input.readInt4x8(i)` / `readUInt4x8(i)` | the eight nibbles of word `i` as a `Float4Pair` — `.low` is nibbles 0..3 and `.high` nibbles 4..7. `i` counts words |
| `input.readInt4x16(i)` / `readUInt4x16(i)` | sixteen nibbles — the same eight bytes, one load — as a `Float4Quad`. `i` counts records of sixteen |
| `unpackInt8x4(bits)` / `unpackUInt8x4(bits)` | the same, from a `UInt` already in hand |
| `unpackInt4x8(bits)` / `unpackUInt4x8(bits)` | likewise for the eight nibbles |
| `packInt8x4(values)` | four `Int4` components packed into a `UInt`, `.x` in the low eight bits |
| `packUInt8x4(values)` | the same from a `UInt4` |
| `writeInt8x4(out, i, values)` / `writeUInt8x4(out, i, values)` | that word stored at `i` — `readInt8x4` reads it back |
| `writeInt8x8(out, i, low, high)` / `writeUInt8x8(out, i, low, high)` | eight bytes packed into two words and laid down in one store at the index `readInt8x8` counts in |
| `writeInt8x16(out, i, a, b, c, d)` / `writeUInt8x16(out, i, a, b, c, d)` | sixteen bytes packed into four words and laid down in one store at the index `readInt8x16` counts in |

The wide byte stores take integer vectors rather than the `Float4Pair` and
`Float4Quad` their reads hand back, and they carry the read's own component
names — `low`/`high`, `a`/`b`/`c`/`d`. It is the same reason `writeInt8x4` takes
an `Int4`: rounding a float back down to a byte is the caller's decision, and a
store that took floats would make it silently.

Signed values are two's complement: a byte over `[-128, 127]`, a nibble over
`[-8, 7]`. Size the buffer in whole words — `readInt8` fetches the word at
`i / 4`, so a count of bytes that is not a multiple of four reads past the last
one on the final element.

Every read in the family is on one index convention: `i` counts records of
whatever the name's last number says, and every record is the elements
`width * i` through `width * i + width - 1` of the buffer. So element `k` is
`readInt8(k)`, and component `k % 16` of `readInt8x16(k / 16)`, and the tests
assert exactly that.

### Pick the widest read, not the widest type

`readInt8x4` is correct and slow, and the reason is worth stating because it is
not obvious from the call: **four bytes is a four-byte load**. `readBFloat16x4`
fetches eight bytes in one load for its four weights, so an int8 kernel written
with `readInt8x4` issues the same number of loads as the bf16 kernel it replaced
for half the data — and stops being bound by bandwidth and starts being bound by
how fast it can issue loads. Halving the bytes then buys a fraction of what it
should. Measured downstream on gemma-2b: bf16 at 427–478 GB/s, int8 through
`readInt8x4` at 298–335 GB/s, a 1.32x decode speedup where halving the bytes
predicts 1.88x.

`readInt8x8` and `readInt8x16` are the fix. They take their words through one
record read — `read2` and `read4` — so the eight or sixteen bytes arrive in a
single vector load wherever the backend has one (a `packed_float2` or
`packed_float4` pointer on Metal, the componentwise construct on HLSL and GLSL),
and the widening is register arithmetic over the value it brought back.
`readInt8x16` is the sixteen-byte load `read4` already lowers to, holding
sixteen weights instead of four.

This is not something to leave to the shader compiler. The graph does share
reads of read-only buffers (see below), so four subscripts of *one* address are
one load — but four subscripts of four consecutive addresses are four different
values and stay four loads, which is exactly what walking a row byte by byte
does. One record read is one node instead, and the emitter names any node it
evaluates more than once, which is what puts the whole record in a local with
the four words as swizzles of it. `GPU/codegenWideInt8Reads` asserts the emitted
MSL has exactly one buffer subscript for a `readInt8x16`, and
`PackedQuantized/aWideReadCostsOneRecordRead` asserts on the real
`ComputeProgram` path that sixteen bytes cost what a `read4` of plain floats
costs.

`Float4Pair` is what an eight-wide read hands back, and `Float4Quad` a
sixteen-wide one, because no dialect has a float8 and inventing one in the EDSL
would leave nothing to emit it into. They are single structs rather than a
`readInt4x8Low` beside a `readInt4x8High` because one fetch should read as one
call — the sharing below would now collapse the two loads either way, but a call
site that fetches once should say so. One read, unpacked in registers:

```cpp
auto w = quantized.readInt4x8(block);
auto sum = dot(w.low, activations.read4(block * 2u))
         + dot(w.high, activations.read4(block * 2u + 1u));
```

`Float4Pair` names its halves `.low` and `.high`; `Float4Quad` letters its four
`.a .b .c .d` rather than inventing a `.lowMid`, which would read as an ordering
of magnitudes where this is an ordering of addresses. Inside a `Float4` the
components already run `x, y, z, w` in the order the bytes sit, so across the
quad `q.a.x` is the record's first element and `q.d.w` its sixteenth:

```cpp
auto w = quantized.readInt8x16(block);
auto sum = dot(w.a, activations.read4(block * 4u))
         + dot(w.b, activations.read4(block * 4u + 1u))
         + dot(w.c, activations.read4(block * 4u + 2u))
         + dot(w.d, activations.read4(block * 4u + 3u));
```

The widening is **bit-identical on every backend**, and that is why the sign
extension is written the way it is. A byte read as unsigned stands for
`(b ^ 0x80) - 128` and a nibble for `(n ^ 0x8) - 8` — arithmetic on values no
wider than the word, moving no bit into or out of a sign position, which MSL,
HLSL and GLSL all define identically. `as_type<char4>` would be Metal's answer
and nothing else's, and shifting a byte up into the sign bit and arithmetically
back asks each language what its own sign bit does under a shift. The same
arithmetic serves Metal and DirectX from one helper string, as `eacpErf` does.

There are four widening helpers for the whole family and no more:
`eacpUnpackInt8x4` and `eacpUnpackInt4x4` and their unsigned twins. The wide
reads are those helpers applied once per word of the record, so a
`readInt8x16` emits one load and four calls, and a `readInt4x16` one load and
four calls of the nibble helper — the high nibbles of a word being the same
helper over the word shifted down sixteen, which is a shift node in the graph
rather than a fifth helper.

`packInt8x4` takes an `Int4` rather than a `Float4` on purpose: narrowing a
float to an integer is a rounding decision and the three dialects each make
their own, so a kernel that has floats rounds them itself — with `round()` or
`floor()` — where the choice is visible. Only the low eight bits of each
component are stored, so a value outside the range wraps rather than saturating;
quantization clamps before this point and nothing is spent re-clamping in the
shader.

`int8x4FromBytes` / `uint8x4FromBytes` / `int4x8FromNibbles` /
`uint4x8FromNibbles` in `PackedVertex.h`, with `int8x4ToByte` and
`int4x8ToNibble` going the other way, are the host side of the same layout —
what a loader turning a quantized checkpoint into a storage buffer writes. They
are per word, and that is all the wide reads need: a record is a run of
consecutive words, so a buffer packed one word at a time reads back through
`readInt8x16` in the order it was written.

## Mipmaps

```cpp
auto descriptor = TextureDescriptor {};
descriptor.width = 1024;
descriptor.height = 1024;
descriptor.mipmapped = true;

auto albedo = Device::shared().makeTexture(descriptor, pixels);
```

What this buys is the picture, not speed. A texture minified without mips samples
a scattering of individual texels, and *which* texels changes as the camera
moves — so a tiled floor or a detailed model shimmers and crawls at distance, and
no filtering at level 0 fixes it, because the information being aliased was
thrown away before the filter saw it. Off by default: a UI atlas or a video frame
is never drawn smaller than it is and would pay a third more memory for levels
nothing reads.

**The chain is built on the CPU, by eacp, for both backends.** Metal has
`generateMipmapsForTexture` and D3D12 has no equivalent at all — a chain there
means a compute shader, a UAV per level and a root signature to bind them. So the
choice was a GPU chain on one backend against a hand-written one on the other,
which is two filters producing two pictures for the same texture, or one filter
producing the same bytes for both. Only the second can be checked by a test, and
this library has been wrong about a cross-backend detail often enough to prefer
the version that can be.

A texture created with no pixels — a render target, a kernel output — gets no
chain, since there is nothing to build one from. `update()` rebuilds it;
`update(region, ...)` does not, because a partial upload cannot know what the
rest of the texture holds. Ask a texture what it got with `mipLevels()`.

**Or hand over a chain of your own**, which is `TextureDescriptor::mipLevels`:

```cpp
descriptor.mipLevels = mipLevelCount(1024, 1024);   // 11 levels in `pixels`

auto albedo = Device::shared().makeTexture(descriptor, pixels);
```

`pixels` is then those levels tightly packed, level 0 first, each one
`levelBytes(format, mipExtent(width, i), mipExtent(height, i))` — the layout
`buildMipChain` already produces, and `mipChainBytes` sizes the block. eacp
uploads them as they arrive and runs no filter of its own.

Two callers want this, and for different reasons. A block-compressed texture has
no other way to have a chain at all — 4x4 blocks cannot be averaged — and every
`.dds` file carries the one its compressor built. And a caller whose own filter
differs on purpose: Doom 3's mip builder preserves a zero border, so a projected
light's low levels stay dark at the edge where an unweighted average spills light
past it.

It is a descriptor field rather than an `update()` overload because both APIs fix
a texture's level count when the resource is created. `mipmapped` beside it is
refused rather than resolved — the two say opposite things about who builds the
chain — as are a count above `mipLevelCount`, null pixels, a render target, a
kernel output and a cube.

No new `TextureSampling` configuration is involved: mip filtering on a
single-level texture is what both APIs do anyway, so the four configurations
still cover everything. That is also where a long-standing divergence was found —
D3D12's static samplers had always declared `MIN_MAG_MIP_LINEAR`, while Metal
left `mipFilter` at its default of `NotMipmapped`. Nothing could see it while no
texture had a second level — and neither could `sample(t, uv, level)`, which
names a level instead of letting the hardware pick one from the derivatives, and
read level 0 whatever it asked for because level 0 was all there was.

## Texture formats

| Format | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `RGBA8Unorm`, `BGRA8Unorm` | The ordinary ones |
| `R8Unorm` | One byte per pixel, sampled as `(r, 0, 0, 1)` — masks, palette indices |
| `RG8Unorm` | Two, sampled as `(r, g, 0, 1)` — an NV12 frame's chroma plane |
| `RGBA16Float` | The float format to reach for |
| `RGBA32Float` | When the mantissa really is the point |
| `R32Float` | One full-precision channel — a depth copy, a distance field |
| `BC1RGBA`, `BC2RGBA`, `BC3RGBA`, `BC7RGBA` | Block-compressed — DXT1/3/5 and BC7 |

The float formats are not an optimisation. Eight bits per channel cannot hold a
value above 1 and quantise everything below it, so a pass that feeds back into
itself — a trail, a fluid, a running average — loses a little of its state every
frame and settles into a flat colour it can no longer leave.

Prefer `RGBA16Float`. Neither backend guarantees a device can *filter* a full
float texture, so a shader sampling one anywhere but at a texel centre would
come back nearest-neighbour on some machines and bilinear on others; half
filters everywhere eacp runs and holds far more range than a colour needs.

The block-compressed formats are for content that **arrived** compressed — a
`.dds` file, an atlas some tool produced. eacp neither compresses nor
decompresses: the blocks go to the device as they came off disk, which is what
saves the decode at load and the four- or eightfold texture memory afterwards. A
4x4 block is one 8-byte record (BC1, so an eighth of RGBA8) or one 16-byte record
(BC2, BC3, BC7, so a quarter), and every size is therefore counted in whole
blocks — `levelBytesPerRow`, `levelRows` and `levelBytes` are what to measure an
upload with, and `bytesPerPixel` answers 0 for them because there is no such
number.

```cpp
descriptor.format = TextureFormat::BC1RGBA;   // 8 bytes per 4x4 block
descriptor.mipLevels = levelsInTheFile;       // the compressor's chain

if (Device::shared().supportsBlockCompression())
    texture = Device::shared().makeTexture(descriptor, fileBytes);
```

Ask the device first: a texture in a format it refuses is invalid rather than
quietly something else, exactly as a refused `sampleCount` is. Every Mac and
every Direct3D device answers yes; an Apple-family iOS GPU mostly does not.

A compressed texture cannot be a render target or a kernel output, `read()` and
`update(region, ...)` are no-ops on one, `update(pixels)` takes the same packed
block the constructor took with `bytesPerRow` at 0, and `mipmapped` gives it
exactly one level — the CPU filter averages texels and a block is not four
numbers to average. `mipLevels` is how it gets a chain. There are no sRGB
variants, eacp having no sRGB formats at all.

## Sampling

How a texture is sampled belongs to the *shader*, not to the `Texture`, which is
a deliberate break from the obvious design and has a Windows driver bug behind
it. See [`SAMPLERS.md`](SAMPLERS.md).

## Driver quirks

Two more D3D12 operations are known to be refused by a shipping driver — the
Parallels virtual GPU fails a command list that resolves a multisampled depth
plane, and removes the device outright on a region read-back — and the backend
routes around both when it finds it is on such a driver. It finds out by
trying: before the real device is created, a throwaway device records each
operation and is asked to close the list, and a refusal sets the matching flag
in `DriverQuirks`. Nothing is identified by name, so a fixed driver drops the
workaround by itself and an unknown driver with the same gap picks it up.
`EACP_D3D12_QUIRKS=1` sets every flag without asking, which is how the
fallback paths are run against WARP.

## How much memory a device wants you to keep

`Device::memoryBudget()` is how many bytes of device-local memory the driver
would rather a process kept resident — not how much exists and not how much is
free, but the number it answers when asked what a well-behaved process should
stay under. DXGI's `QueryVideoMemoryInfo` local budget on D3D12,
`recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` on Metal, the largest `DEVICE_LOCAL` heap on
Vulkan, and zero from a backend that will not say. A discrete card answers its
own memory; a unified one answers a share of the system's, and lavapipe answers
host RAM, which is right because that is where its device memory comes from.

It exists because anything holding storage of its own has to size itself against
something. `BufferPool` is the first caller: it keeps at most a quarter of that,
capped at what the work actually reuses. A caller's own allocator wants the same
number.

## How big a grid is allowed to be

Metal has no practical ceiling on a dispatch's threadgroup count. D3D12 has
one, and Vulkan usually has the same one: **65535 threadgroups per dimension**
(`D3D12_CS_DISPATCH_MAX_THREAD_GROUPS_PER_DIMENSION`,
`maxComputeWorkGroupCount`). So a grid written on a Mac can be illegal on the
other two, and the way it fails is worth knowing, because it is not an error.

What an over-sized dimension actually does is the driver's business rather than
the API's. On an NVIDIA Ada card, an **X** count far past the cap runs
correctly — the hardware's own limit there is about 2^31 — while a **Y** count
past it produces *nothing at all*: no error, no removed device, no validation
message, just a dispatch that never happened and whatever the kernel would have
written left as it was. A 30-second decode came out as a WAV of digital
silence, and the only visible difference from a working run was the samples.

The lesson is not "check the cap at every call site". It is that a dimension
should be something the work actually has. Attention dispatched `rows * heads`
as one dimension and crossed the cap at 161 latent frames; rows and heads are
two different things, and given a dimension each neither comes near it at any
clip length. `ComputePass` on D3D12 says when a grid is past the cap and names
the dimensions — it neither clamps nor skips, because an X grid past the cap is
out of spec and does run, and refusing it would break work that succeeds today.

## Two functions that name things are one coin flip

A code generator that hands out names while it walks is a state machine, and
C++ will not sequence it for you. This emitted a different shader depending on
what compiled the emitter:

```cpp
return define(operands, indent, uses, open)
       + holdTheRecord(statement, indent, open);
```

Both calls hand out local names. The operands of `+` are unsequenced, so clang
evaluated left to right and named the operands first, while MSVC evaluated
right to left and named the record first — and the record then went unnamed and
was printed into each component of its store instead of once into a local. The
values were right either way, which is why it survived: it showed up only as a
golden text mismatch, on Windows, against goldens written from a clang build.

Sequence anything that names, allocates a slot or advances a counter into its
own statement. One state-mutating call per expression.

The same holds for a shader written in the EDSL, because the calls that declare
things are the same kind of state machine: `varying`, `vertexInput`,
`instanceInput`, `var`, `shared`, the buffer and texture declarations and
`atomicAdd` each take the next slot or append a statement. The sprite shader
wrote

```cpp
setFragment(sample(image, varying(uv)) * varying(tint));
```

and clang gave `uv` varying 0 and `tint` varying 1 while GCC and MSVC gave them
the other way round — a correct shader either way, and a golden mismatch on
every lane but the one that wrote the goldens. Name each one in a local first,
in the order the slots should come out:

```cpp
auto fragmentUv = varying(uv);
auto fragmentTint = varying(tint);
setFragment(sample(image, fragmentUv) * fragmentTint);
```

Arguments of one call are just as unsequenced as operands of `*`, so
`float4(varying(a), varying(b))` is the same bug. Declarations separated by
commas (`auto a = var(zero), b = var(zero);`) are fine: each initialiser is its
own full-expression.

## Reading pixels back

`View::renderToImage` renders off-screen and hands back a `Graphics::Image`. It
is what the GPU tests check their output with, and it is worth knowing that what
comes back is what Core Animation composites — which is **premultiplied**. A
fragment left at alpha 0.25 comes back with its colour divided by four, and two
values that differed before that division can arrive equal after it. Write an
opaque alpha, or compare two renders rather than either against a number.

`Texture::read` is the other half, and the one an app that composes its frame
into a render target wants: the texture's own pixels, in its own format, with no
compositor in between and no second render. It is `update()` backwards — rows
tightly packed at the format's `bytesPerPixel` unless a stride says otherwise,
row 0 at the top, a region overload beside the whole-texture one.

**It reads what has been committed, not what has been recorded**, which is the
rule `Buffer::read` already carries and the one that catches people. A frame's
passes reach the GPU when the frame ends, so this:

```cpp
void render(Frame& frame) override
{
    { auto pass = frame.beginPass(target); pass.draw(scene); }

    frame.flush();           // <- without this, the read is a frame behind
    target.read(pixels.data());
}
```

`Frame::flush()` sends everything recorded so far and carries on recording, so
the read that follows it sees the passes above it. No pass may be open when it
is called — a command buffer takes one encoder at a time — and it costs Metal's
*frame* timing, which is read off a command buffer and after a flush there are
two of those. Nothing else needs it: two passes on one frame already see each
other's results without it.

Both calls block until the GPU has finished. That is what a read-back is; it is
not something to put in a frame loop.

## Windows

The D3D12 backend is less exercised than the Metal one. Notes worth having:

- Samplers are static samplers in the root signature, not descriptor tables —
  again, see `SAMPLERS.md`
- Resource Binding Tier 1 hardware requires *every* descriptor table the root
  signature declares to be populated before a draw, even ones the shader never
  reads, so unused texture slots are seeded with a null descriptor
- Buffers decay to `COMMON` after every `ExecuteCommandLists` and are implicitly
  promoted on first use; textures do not, so a texture's state is tracked for
  its whole lifetime rather than per recording
- A buffer's storage says which of two very different writes it gets.
  `BufferStorage::Device` — the default, and every buffer an app makes — is a
  default-heap resource filled by a staged copy: a memcpy into the recording's
  upload arena, a barrier to `COPY_DEST`, a `CopyBufferRegion` and a barrier
  back before the draw. `BufferStorage::Streaming`, which is what
  `StreamingBuffers` asks for its arenas, is an `UPLOAD`-heap resource mapped
  once and kept mapped, bound as vertex, index or constant data straight out of
  that mapping: the write is the memcpy and nothing is recorded at all. Upload
  heaps are permanently in `GENERIC_READ`, so none of those barriers exists to
  be recorded either — which is why a renderer streaming hundreds of ranges a
  frame pays for hundreds of copy commands on one and none on the other. What
  buys it is the rule `StreamingBuffers` already keeps: no arena is written
  while a frame that drew from it can still be on the GPU

## Linux

The Vulkan backend draws, on screen and off. `Device`, `Buffer`,
`ShaderLibrary`, `ComputePipeline`, `ComputePass`, `CommandBuffer`,
`GpuTimestamps`, `Texture`, `RenderPipeline`, `RenderPass` and both `Frame`
constructors are real. `GPUView::renderNativeContent` renders into an off-screen
target and reads it back — the path every pixel-comparison test rides — so all
of `Tests/GPU` (bar the Metal-only `TextureInteropTests.mm`) and
`Tests/GPUWidgets` run on lavapipe with no display at all; and a `GPUView` in a
`Graphics::Window` presents through a `VK_KHR_swapchain` over whichever window
system that window came up on, Wayland or X11 — as does one in an
`EmbeddedView`, whose surface is an X11 child of a window a host owns, and which
is the same code path from `createSurface()` down. The backend is built on every
Linux build, exactly as the Metal and D3D12 backends are on theirs;
`-DEACP_BUILD_GRAPHICS=OFF` is the only thing that leaves it out.

Notes worth having:

- **Nothing links the loader.** `volkInitialize()` opens `libvulkan.so.1` by
  name at runtime, so the build needs no Vulkan package and the same binary runs
  on a machine with no driver — `Device::isValid()` is false there, which is
  what every GPU test already self-skips on. The headers, `volk` and
  VulkanMemoryAllocator are CPM-fetched (`CMake/FindVulkanBackend.cmake`) and
  fetched on no other platform.
- **Vulkan 1.3 core is the floor**, plus five features asked for by name:
  `timelineSemaphore`, `synchronization2`, `dynamicRendering`,
  `descriptorBindingPartiallyBound` and `shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat`
  (the emitter declares a written texture as a `writeonly image2D` with no
  format qualifier). A device missing one is not used, rather than used until it
  fails.
- **eacp ships its own shader compiler here**, which it does on neither other
  backend: GLSL 450 through glslang into SPIR-V, at a fixed ~2 MB per binary and
  a one-time ~90 ms symbol-table build that `VulkanShared` pays at device
  creation so it never lands in a frame.
- **Memory is sub-allocated by VMA**, not one allocation per buffer:
  `maxMemoryAllocationCount` is commonly 4096, so the committed-resource model
  D3D12 uses would run a scene out of allocations long before it ran out of
  memory.
- **A second `Device` shares the queue.** A D3D12 command queue is created on
  demand; a `VkQueue` comes out of a family with a driver-decided count, and
  lavapipe offers one. So the queue lives in `VulkanShared` behind a mutex, and
  what keeps two Devices independent is everything else — their own command
  pools, timeline semaphores, upload arenas, constant rings and descriptor
  pools. `nativeQueue()` is therefore the same handle for every Device here.
- **Every recording ends with a global memory barrier.** Consecutive submissions
  on a queue execute in order but are not automatically visible to one another,
  and one barrier per submit is a rounding error against the dozens a frame
  would otherwise need. It is what makes the per-recording use tracking in
  `transitionForUse` correct, and it is the analogue of D3D12 buffers decaying
  to `COMMON` after every `ExecuteCommandLists`.
- **A storage buffer's offset is the device's**, which is why the rule is
  `Device::storageBufferOffsetAlignment()` rather than a constant four. Vulkan
  writes the offset into a descriptor, and a descriptor may name no offset off
  `minStorageBufferOffsetAlignment` — 16 on lavapipe, and up to 256 by the spec,
  against the four Metal and D3D12 each take. A range off the device's grid
  binds nothing here, exactly as one past the buffer's end does, on a kernel's
  slots and on `setVertexStorageBuffer`/`setFragmentStorageBuffer` alike, so a
  caller that sub-allocates by row asks the device for the step — which is what
  the ranged cases in `Tests/GPU/UIntBufferTests.cpp` and
  `ComputeBufferRangeTests.cpp` do.
- **`CommandBuffer::fill` is `vkCmdFillBuffer`**, whose word is the byte
  repeated four times, so the offset and the length are on the same four-byte
  grid the API documents and the length is clamped to the buffer's end. Nothing
  orders it by hand: the fill is a transfer write like any other, so the same
  `transitionForUse` tracking that orders a dispatch against an upload orders it
  against the passes either side.
- **An off-screen command buffer is timed by the query pool a frame is.**
  `CommandTimer` drives the same `GpuTimestamps` — one slot rather than four,
  the pass's pair written at `TOP_OF_PIPE` and `BOTTOM_OF_PIPE` around the
  encoder as `Frame::timePass` writes them, and the pool reset and the buffer's
  own two queries recorded by the first labelled pass. A command buffer that
  labelled nothing creates no pool.
- **A pass is one `vkCmdBeginRendering`; there is no `VkRenderPass`.**
  `DepthAction` is the attachment's load and store ops — `Clear` is
  `CLEAR`/`DONT_CARE`, `Keep` is `CLEAR`/`STORE`, `Resume` is `LOAD`/`STORE`,
  never Vulkan's own suspend/resume. A multisampled target draws into its
  companion image and resolves through the attachment's resolve fields at the
  end of every pass, so the texture always holds the resolved picture; a
  sampleable depth on such a target resolves with `SAMPLE_ZERO`, which is what
  Metal does and why the shader fallback D3D12 needed does not exist here.
- **Barriers are hoisted to pass boundaries**, because Vulkan forbids one inside
  a rendering instance. Between passes every colour image rests in a layout a
  pass can sample (`SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`; `GENERAL` for a `computeWrite`
  texture, since a sampler reads that too; the multisample companion stays
  `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`), an upload leaves the image there the moment the
  copy is recorded, and a pass moves its attachments in at begin and back out at
  end. One global barrier before `vkCmdBeginRendering` orders every earlier copy
  and dispatch on the recording against the draws, and after that no bind
  records anything. An upload made while a pass is open takes a recording of
  its own, submitted ahead of the frame — the thing `Texture-Windows.cpp` does
  for textures and Metal forbids outright.
- **One descriptor set per draw, elided when nothing changed.** The render set
  is shared by every pipeline (`descriptorBindingPartiallyBound`, so only the
  slots actually bound are written); the uniform block is one
  `UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC` at binding 0 with the block's offset in the constant
  ring as the dynamic offset. The emitter writes exactly one block for both
  stages, so `setVertexBytes` and `setFragmentBytes` write the same descriptor
  and the last one wins — safe because `RenderPass::setUniforms` hands both the
  same bytes, and documented at that call site. Samplers travel with the image
  in the descriptor write (`VulkanShared::getSampler`) rather than being
  immutable in the layout, which would have needed a layout per shader.
- **A texture slot has one binding number and two possible descriptor types.**
  The binding map (`Codegen/ShaderBindings.h`) gives a slot one binding whether
  a kernel samples it or writes it, matching the Metal indices; Vulkan gives a
  binding one type. So a compute pipeline reflects its SPIR-V
  (`spirvTextureBindings`) and builds a descriptor-set layout of its own naming
  each declared slot as the `COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` or `STORAGE_IMAGE` the
  module declared; a kernel that binds no texture shares the one layout in
  `VulkanShared`. A render shader only ever samples, so its set needs no such
  split.
- **Pipelines are built through one `VkPipelineCache`** held by `VulkanShared`
  and persisted to `pipelines-<pipelineCacheUUID>.bin` in the app's
  `FilePath::appCacheDirectory()` (under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`, or
  `$HOME/.cache` when unset), beside the SPIR-V `ShaderBinaryCache` keeps in its
  `Shaders` folder: loaded at device creation when its header
  names this device, written back through a temp file and rename at teardown,
  and silently skipped on any failure. There is no hash cache above it, because
  a `RenderPipeline` or `ComputePipeline` is one object and one create call
  and nothing in the backend makes an equal one twice. Mesa's lavapipe stores
  nothing in its cache, so on the software lane the file is a 32-byte header.
- **A texture created without pixels is transitioned at creation** into the
  resting layout its use tracking claims, through the same recording an upload
  takes, so a bind before the first write never names a layout the image is
  not in. And a multisampled, sampleable-depth target is refused at creation
  on a device whose depth-resolve modes lack `SAMPLE_ZERO`
  (`VulkanShared::resolvesDepthBySampleZero`) rather than built with an
  undefined read; no such device has been seen.
- **NDC y is the one axis Vulkan differs on**, and the fix is a negative
  viewport height — applied at pass begin, in `setViewport` and in
  `clearViewport`, and nowhere else — so `Winding::CounterClockwise` maps
  straight to `VK_FRONT_FACE_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE`, cull mode and front face are
  baked into the pipeline, and `CullModeTests`, `ViewportTests` and
  `CoordinateSpaceTests` pass unchanged. See `plan.md` §3.5 for why the two
  other fixes are wrong.

### The swapchain

`GPUView` asks `Graphics::requestViewSurface` for a `ViewSurface`
(`Graphics/View/View-Linux.h`) and creates a `VkSurfaceKHR` over the
`NativeSurfaceHandle` the window backend reports on it — a kind tag, a
connection, a `wl_surface*` or an X11 window id. That record — the handle, a
pixel size, a scale and five hooks — is the whole of what `eacp-gpu` knows
about the window system: `createSurface()` switches on the kind between
`vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR` and `vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR`, and everything below
it is shared. It neither links nor includes libwayland or xcb beyond what
`vulkan_wayland.h` and `vulkan_xcb.h` pull in, and `VK_USE_PLATFORM_WAYLAND_KHR`
with `VK_USE_PLATFORM_XCB_KHR` (`CMake/FindVulkanBackend.cmake`, `PUBLIC` so
`volk.c` sees them too) is what makes the two creators reachable.
`VK_KHR_surface` with `VK_KHR_wayland_surface` and `VK_KHR_xcb_surface` on the
instance and `VK_KHR_swapchain` on the device are enabled only where they are
offered — the two window systems independently, since a driver may carry either,
which is why each creator is null-checked before it is called: volk leaves the
pointer null for an extension that was not enabled.
`VulkanShared::supportsPresentation()` says whether any of it was — a headless
ICD, or a loader with no WSI, leaves a `GPUView` rendering off-screen exactly as
it did before there was a swapchain. lavapipe presents to an Xvfb over
`VK_KHR_xcb_surface` with no help, which is how the `Present` cases run on the
CI lane's second test step.

- **A swapchain image is a `VulkanTextureData` with one flag set.**
  `presentable` makes `restingUse()` answer `PRESENT_SRC_KHR`, so the image
  leaves every pass ready for `vkQueuePresentKHR` and `RenderPass::end` needs no
  swapchain case at all. The acquired image's tracked layout is reset to
  `UNDEFINED` each frame — its contents are undefined anyway — at
  `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT` rather than at no stage, so the first pass's
  transition is ordered behind the acquire semaphore, which is waited on there.
- **The multisample and depth buffers are one pair for the whole swapchain**,
  not one per image: both are scratch space within a frame, and the layout each
  is in is lent to whichever image the frame renders into and taken back
  afterwards. They are built by the same
  `createVulkanMultisampleCompanion`/`createVulkanDepthCompanion` a render-target
  `Texture` uses, so a multisampled window and a multisampled texture cannot
  drift apart. `setSampleCount`/`setDepth`/`setStencil` rebuild them at the next
  frame.
- **One acquire semaphore per frame in flight, one render-finished semaphore per
  swapchain image.** The second half is the one that is easy to get wrong: the
  present waits on the image's semaphore, so a second frame reaching the same
  image while the first present was outstanding would reuse a semaphore that is
  still in play. `framesInFlight()` is clamped to `[1, imageCount - 1]`, and the
  CPU throttle is the context timeline — a slot's acquire semaphore is not
  handed out again until the value its last frame submitted has passed. Nothing
  waits per frame beyond that, and `vkDeviceWaitIdle` happens only on a
  swapchain rebuild and on teardown.
- **Frames are paced by the window system, not by a clock.** There is no
  `DisplayLink` here. Continuous mode renders, asks for a frame callback
  (before the present, which is the commit that carries the request on
  Wayland), and renders again when `ViewSurface::onFrameDone` says the last
  frame was taken — so a hidden or occluded window, which gets no callbacks,
  renders nothing, and the main thread never blocks inside
  `vkAcquireNextImageKHR`. On Wayland that callback is `wl_surface.frame`; X11
  has no equivalent, so the backend answers from a timer at the RandR mode's
  rate — rebuilt at the new rate when a RandR change moves it — and this loop
  does not know the difference. The
  acquire is given a 100 ms timeout rather than `UINT64_MAX` for the same
  reason. `setMaxFps` uses the divider `DisplayLink::setMaxFps` documents: a
  tick that arrives too early presents nothing and asks for the next callback
  again, and `ViewSurface::requestFrameCallback` commits the subsurface on its
  own when no present will, so the loop carries across the skip with no timer
  beside it.
- **Present modes**: `MAILBOX` where the surface offers it, so a renderer faster
  than the display drops frames instead of blocking; `FIFO` otherwise, which the
  spec guarantees. Format `B8G8R8A8_UNORM` + `SRGB_NONLINEAR` where offered
  (matching what the off-screen snapshot renders into and what the other two
  backends give their swapchains), else the first offered; composite alpha
  `OPAQUE` else the first offered; `minImageCount + 1` images clamped to
  `maxImageCount`; `preTransform` taken as the surface's own. Wayland reports
  `currentExtent` as `0xFFFFFFFF` — there is no server-side surface size — so the
  extent comes from the record's `pixelWidth`/`pixelHeight`; X11 reports the
  child window's real size and that is taken as it stands.
- **Rebuilds** are marked and done at the next frame, so a live resize that
  reports twenty sizes builds one swapchain: `onResized`, and `OUT_OF_DATE` or
  `SUBOPTIMAL` from either the acquire or the present. A `SUBOPTIMAL` acquire is
  drawn and presented first — it handed over an image and signalled the
  semaphore, and dropping it would leave that semaphore signalled. `onLost`
  destroys the swapchain, the semaphores, the companions and the `VkSurfaceKHR`
  synchronously, before the `wl_surface` or the child window goes: a swapchain
  outliving its surface is a use-after-free inside the driver, not an error
  code.
- **`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` stops the view and does not restart it.** It is
  logged once, the swapchain and surface are torn down, and `onDeviceRestored`
  never fires — rebuilding the `VkDevice` would mean rebuilding every `Buffer`,
  `Texture` and pipeline made on the old one, and the machinery D3D12 has for
  that (a live-view registry, a device replacement inside `Device::Native`) does
  not exist here. That is the one place this backend is behind the Windows one.
- **`renderNativeContent` is independent of all of it**: it renders into a
  `Texture` of its own through the waiting off-screen `Frame`, works whether or
  not a swapchain is up, and is what the whole headless GPU suite rides on.

### Running it

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build
EACP_REQUIRE_GPU=1 EACP_VK_SOFTWARE=1 ctest --test-dir build
```

| Variable | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `EACP_VK_SOFTWARE=1` | Prefers a `PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU` device — Mesa's lavapipe. The mirror of `EACP_D3D12_WARP`, and for the same reason: a conformant reference implementation is how you tell your bug from the driver's. It inverts the preference order rather than filtering, so a machine whose only device is a real GPU still gets one. |
| `EACP_REQUIRE_GPU=1` | Makes `GPUTests` fail when no device came up. Every other GPU test self-skips without one and ctest scores that as a pass, so a lane whose driver was never installed reports a full green suite that ran nothing; `DevicePresenceTests` is the one case that does not skip, and it prints the device's name either way. |
| `EACP_VK_VALIDATION=1` | Enables `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` with a debug-utils messenger that logs warnings and errors through `LOG`. Off by default — the layer costs several times the driver's own time per call. |
| `EACP_REQUIRE_DISPLAY=1` | The swapchain's sibling of `EACP_REQUIRE_GPU`. `Tests/GPU/PresentTests-Linux.cpp` needs a display server — a compositor, or an X server where `EACP_WINDOW_SYSTEM=x11` — and every case in it self-skips without one, which ctest scores as a pass. This makes those cases fail instead, so a lane whose Weston or Xvfb session did not come up says so. Set it wherever the suite is run under a display server; leave it unset everywhere else. |
| `EACP_HEADLESS=1` | Not Vulkan's, but it belongs here: it is what tells the window backend to build no surface, and therefore what the present tests read to decide there is nothing to present to. |

CI runs the suite on lavapipe with `EACP_VK_SOFTWARE`, `EACP_REQUIRE_GPU` and
`EACP_VK_VALIDATION` set and no display server. The lavapipe ICD manifest is
named per architecture (`lvp_icd.x86_64.json` on an x86-64 runner,
`lvp_icd.json` in an arm64 container), so nothing sets `VK_DRIVER_FILES` — the
loader finds it from the ICD directory.

The present tests need a display server, and they run against both: Weston's
headless backend for Wayland and an Xvfb for X11 — `with-weston <command>` and
`with-xvfb <command>` in the `Dockerfile` run a command inside one each, the
second exporting `EACP_WINDOW_SYSTEM=x11` so the same cases come up on the
other backend:

```bash
docker run --rm -e EACP_VK_SOFTWARE=1 -e EACP_REQUIRE_GPU=1 \
    -e EACP_REQUIRE_DISPLAY=1 -v "$PWD":/workspace eacp-ci-linux \
    with-weston ctest --test-dir build-ci-linux --output-on-failure \
    -E '^(X11|EmbeddedView)/'

docker run --rm -e EACP_VK_SOFTWARE=1 -e EACP_REQUIRE_GPU=1 \
    -e EACP_REQUIRE_DISPLAY=1 -v "$PWD":/workspace eacp-ci-linux \
    with-xvfb ctest --test-dir build-ci-linux --output-on-failure \
    -R '^(X11|EmbeddedView|Present)/'
```
