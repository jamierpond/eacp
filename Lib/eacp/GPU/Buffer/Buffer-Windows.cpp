// Windows/D3D12 backend. A BufferStorage::Device buffer is a default-heap
// resource (a Storage buffer additionally allows unordered access); initial
// data goes through a transient upload buffer submitted at construction, and
// read() copies into a readback buffer and blocks on the fence, preserving the
// contract that a read after commit() sees the kernel's output. State is
// tracked per recording in D3D12BufferData; cross-submit ordering comes from
// the single direct queue.
//
// A BufferStorage::Streaming buffer is the other shape entirely: one
// UPLOAD-heap resource, mapped once and kept mapped, whose GPU address is bound
// as vertex, index or constant data in place. Every write is a memcpy through
// that mapping and puts nothing on a command list - no staging chunk, no
// CopyBufferRegion, no barrier either side of it - which is what a renderer
// streaming hundreds of ranges a frame is here for. Correctness comes from the
// caller instead: see BufferStorage in Buffer.h, and StreamingBuffers, which is
// the caller that has it.
