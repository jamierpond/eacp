// backends get the same recycling out of one implementation, which is what
// makes this a safe thing to add to a two-backend module.
//
// The arenas are BufferStorage::Streaming, which is the one thing here that
// reaches into a backend, and this type is the reason that storage can exist at
// all. A streamed write goes straight into memory the GPU may read without a
// copy to order it behind, so what makes it safe is that no arena is ever
// written while a frame that drew from it can still be in flight - the pool
// rotation below, and nothing else. On D3D12 that turns a write from a memcpy
// plus a barrier, a CopyBufferRegion and a barrier back into a memcpy; on Metal
// it is what a write already was.
