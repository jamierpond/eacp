// kernel and can be read back to the CPU. On Metal all are plain MTLBuffers;
// on D3D12 the usage picks the resource flags (a Storage buffer allows
// unordered access so a kernel can write it).

// Where a buffer's storage lives, which is a statement about who writes it
// rather than about what it is bound as.
//
// Device is the default and what an app's own geometry wants: memory the GPU
// reads out of its own heap, filled through a staged copy. Streaming says the
// CPU rewrites these bytes every frame and the GPU only ever reads them, which
// buys a very different deal on D3D12 - the resource lives on the UPLOAD heap,
// stays mapped for its whole life, and is bound as vertex, index or constant
// data straight out of that mapping. A write is then one memcpy and records
// nothing: no staging chunk, no CopyBufferRegion, and no pair of barriers
// around it, since an upload-heap resource is permanently in GENERIC_READ. A
// renderer streaming hundreds of ranges a frame pays hundreds of barriers and
// copy commands for the Device answer and none at all for this one.
//
// What it costs is that the memory is CPU-visible and write-combined, so the
// GPU reads it across the bus rather than out of its own heap, and that
// nothing may rewrite a byte the GPU has not finished reading - there is no
// copy in the command stream for the write to be ordered behind. That second
// one is StreamingBuffers' whole contract, which is why this is the storage
// its arenas ask for and not something a long-lived buffer should reach for.
//
// On Metal it says nothing new: every eacp buffer is already a shared-storage
// MTLBuffer, and update() there already is the memcpy this asks for.
//
// A Storage buffer keeps device storage whatever is asked here. A kernel
// writing through a UAV is precisely what an upload heap cannot do, and a
// creation that quietly failed would be far worse than paying for the copy.

// Memory the caller already owns, handed to a Buffer to be used where it lies
// rather than copied into one. Device::makeBufferOverMemory takes one; the
// tensors of a mapped weights file are what it is for, where a copy would mean
// a second few gigabytes and the time to write them.
//
// bytes must sit on Buffer::memoryPageSize(), because that is what the backend
// that can adopt memory asks of it, and a descriptor off that grid makes an
// invalid Buffer rather than a quietly copied one - so the contract is the same
// everywhere and code written on one backend keeps working on the next. An
// eacp::MemoryMappedFile of a whole file is already on the grid.
//
// byteCount is free of that: the buffer covers whole pages underneath, and the
// page the last byte lies in is already mapped, so a length that stops
// mid-page costs nothing and no range can be built past what the caller owns -
// size() is the count given here rather than the rounded one.
//
// What that rounding does mean is that the GPU is handed up to
// memoryPageSize() - 1 bytes past byteCount, inside the page the last byte
// already lies in. Nothing eacp encodes reaches them, since every bound range
// is clamped to size(); a caller whose last page holds something it would
// rather the GPU could not address should map or allocate that tail itself.
//
// onReleased is called once, when the memory is no longer the buffer's: when
// the Buffer is destroyed where the memory was adopted, and as soon as the copy
// has been taken where it was not. It is where a caller that mapped or

// is routinely past what an int holds: a language model's weight shard is
// gigabytes, and a batch of logits reaches two of them at a few thousand rows.
// An int count wrapped there silently, allocating something small and negative

    // can see: on Metal, whose buffers are all shared storage, and on a

    // submitted are not held back.

    // That wait is new, and it is a cost every existing caller now pays: an
    // update that used to be a bare memcpy on Metal is a memcpy behind a wait
    // for the newest submission. Code that was already right by construction —

    // its geometry every tick cannot afford a wait for the newest submission in

    // of overlapping — so it buys the ordering some other way. StreamingBuffers
    // is that other way, and never hands out bytes from an arena a frame still
    // in flight was drawn from.
    //
    // The second is a caller that has ordered by hand and knows more than a
    // Buffer can: it waited on the command buffer that wrote these bytes, or it
    // read them back, or it is a step-by-step loop where the writer finished
    // long ago and only a later, unrelated submission is still running.
    // CommandBuffer::update is that case with the wait built in and scoped to
    // one command buffer, and is the better call where the writer is known.
