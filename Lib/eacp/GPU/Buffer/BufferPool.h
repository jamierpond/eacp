// Where Device::makeBuffer(bytes, usage) gets its storage, so that work
// recorded again and again - an inference step, a frame's compute - stops
// asking the device for fresh memory for every temporary each time round. A
// fresh buffer costs more than an allocation: on Metal its pages are zeroed and
// made resident before the command buffer that first uses it can run (about
// 75 ms of a 290 ms Stable Audio medium DiT step, for 1,587 temporaries), and
// on D3D12 each one is a CreateCommittedResource.
//
// Nothing to call: a Buffer from makeBuffer(bytes) gives its storage back here
// when it is destroyed, and a later makeBuffer of the same size and usage takes
// it again - but only once the GPU has finished every submission that could
// still be using it, which is everything submitted before the Buffer went and
// the one submitted next, the command buffer still being recorded when a
// temporary goes out of scope mid-encode. The one order that does not cover is
// two command buffers recorded at once and submitted out of order, the older
// after the newer, with a pooled buffer destroyed in between.
//
// So the contents of such a buffer are whatever was there, as the name
// "uninitialised" always allowed. Storage no makeBuffer asks for through a few
// submissions is freed, so the pool holds on to what the work is still using
// and not to what it has moved on from. Buffers made with data, and adopted
// memory, never come from here.
//
// One per Device, used from the Device's own thread. A Buffer reaches its pool
// through a BufferPoolLink it holds weakly, so a Buffer that outlives its
// Device finds the link expired and frees its storage, and one destroyed on
// any thread but the Device's frees it too rather than touching the pool.
// Only on Metal does that make destroying one off the Device's thread safe:
// on D3D12 and Vulkan freeing any Buffer goes through its context's deferred
// release lists, which are not locked, so there every Buffer, pooled or not,
// is still destroyed on the Device's thread.

    // once, so two was enough for its temporaries to survive into the next
    // step, but a codec decode submits four to six times, so with two every
    // temporary it made was freed before the next decode asked for that size
    // - 181 buffers and 1.5 GB re-created per decode, for no reuse at all.

    // then sits idle - a plugin between renders, a UI between frames - holds
    // whatever it last used for ever. Generating one medium clip left 6.0 GB
    // in the pool before this, which is not memory an idle app should keep.
    //
    // Two gigabytes is what the work here actually reuses (a decode turns over
    // about 1.5 GB), and holding more than it reuses buys nothing - so this is
    // a ceiling and not a target. A device too small to spare that gets a
    // quarter of what it recommends instead, which is the number that matters
