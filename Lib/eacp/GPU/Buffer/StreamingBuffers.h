{
// Storage for data rewritten every frame.
//
// Buffer::update does not synchronise against frames still in flight, so
// writing one buffer each tick tears the picture. This keeps one arena per
// frame that may be in flight and hands out slices of the current frame's
// arena, reclaiming an arena only once the frame that used it can no longer
// be on the GPU.
//
// Several writes in one frame get several slices, which is the part a rotating
// single buffer gets wrong. A batching renderer flushes many times per frame
// through one shader - on every texture change, sampling change, scissor change
// and again at pass end - and each flush's draw is still queued in the command
// buffer when the next flush is written. One buffer per frame, rewritten from
// the start each time, would have the second write land on top of geometry the
// first draw has not consumed yet. Slices of one buffer, each after the last,
// cannot.
//
// One arena rather than one buffer per write, and the difference is the whole
// cost model. A renderer that streams its geometry per draw - a game issuing a
// thousand draws a frame, each with its own vertices - makes a thousand writes
// a frame. As a thousand GPU buffers that is a thousand resources for the
// driver to make resident before every command buffer can be scheduled, and a
// thousand buffers each sized for the largest write that ever happened to land
// in its position, which keeps reallocating for as long as the draw order keeps
// changing. As slices of one arena it is one resource, a memcpy per write, and
// nothing allocated once the arena is as big as the frame. What a slice costs
// is what it is: its bytes, rounded up to an alignment.
//
// The arenas are BufferStorage::Streaming, so a write is a memcpy into memory
// the GPU reads in place - on Metal because a shared MTLBuffer always was one,
// on D3D12 because the arena is an UPLOAD-heap resource kept mapped and bound
// as vertex, index or constant data where it lies. Nothing about a write
// reaches a command list, which is the difference between a frame of hundreds
// of streamed ranges costing hundreds of copies and barriers and costing none -
// and which means the rotation below is the only thing keeping a write off
// bytes a frame still in flight is reading. That is the trade this type is: the
// storage is cheap to write precisely because something else guarantees when it
// may be written, and this is that something.
//
// Arenas grow on demand and never shrink, so steady state allocates nothing;
// Device::buffersCreated() is the number that says so, and bufferCount() is
// framesInFlight once every pool is warm.
//
// Which frame a write belongs to comes from Device's own counter, which Frame
// bumps. There is deliberately no advance() to call, and therefore none to
// forget - the same instinct as RenderPass::Participant. A forgotten advance
// would show up as tearing in whichever renderer forgot it, which is about the
// hardest kind of bug there is to attribute.
//
// This means a frame is what Frame says it is. Data streamed outside one - a
// CommandBuffer submitted on its own - stays on a single pool and keeps taking
// slices from it, so this is not the type for that; a plain Buffer is, since
// CommandBuffer::commit blocks and nothing is in flight after it. Inside one
// long frame - a load screen redrawn many times before its tick ends - the
// arena simply grows to hold every write of it, which is bytes rather than
// resources, and what it grew to is kept for the next frame that needs it.

    // Slices start on alignment-byte boundaries, so two writes in one frame
    // never share one; what that costs is at most alignment - 1 bytes a write.
