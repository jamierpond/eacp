// The one thing a reduction cannot rule out.
//
// FrameCompute/sharedMemoryGroupSums folds a tile in half per barrier, which
// says the memory is shared and the barrier orders it - but a tree reduction
// reads slots this thread's own half of the tile wrote, so a lane that read
// only itself would still fold to something. What is left to check is the flat
// case: every thread reads the lane **opposite** its own, so no thread reads
// anything it wrote. On per-thread scratch that comes back as the identity
// rather than as a reversal, which no amount of arithmetic can disguise.
