// What is being pinned is the scope rather than the speed: a wait that reached
// past this command buffer would still give the right numbers, so every case
// here that could pass by accident is paired with a second command buffer whose
// work is still running. The last of them is the shape a step-by-step loop
// takes - record and submit step k+1, then wait for step k and read it - and it
// is the one that fails if wait() ever waits for the newest submission again.
//
// The last case is about Buffer::update rather than about scope: a host write
// into a buffer a kernel is still filling is ordered by update() and by nothing
// else, and the kernel it races is slow enough that an unordered write loses.
