// Device is documented as an instantiable class whose shared() is a
// convenience, and these pin that it actually is one: two Devices are two
// queues, two command-list pools and two constant rings, and a Device built on
// a worker thread runs work there without touching the main thread's.
//
// That is what lets an inference worker submit at 30 fps without queueing
// behind the UI's frames. Metal has always honoured it - Device::Native holds
// its MTLCommandQueue as an instance member - and it is the D3D12 backend these
// caught, where every Device forwarded to one process-wide context.
//
// These are also the positive half of Device::assertOwningThread: every case
// below runs a whole chain - buffers, pipeline, command buffer, read-back - on
// the thread that made the Device, and a worker reaching Device::shared() to
// compile a kernel does not take ownership of it. There is no negative case and
// there cannot be one here: the rule is an assert, and an assert that fires
// aborts the run rather than failing a test.
