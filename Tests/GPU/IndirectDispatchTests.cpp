// A dispatch whose size the GPU decided.
//
// The point is not that a grid can be read out of a buffer - it is that the
// number never reaches the CPU. A stage sized by what the stage before it found
// would otherwise need a readback between two passes that were going to be
// adjacent, and a readback is a round trip through the host.
//
// So the test never reads the count. It reads only the *effect*: a second kernel
// that ran exactly as many times as the first kernel decided it should. The
// count is derived from buffer contents the test writes, so the answer is known
// here without ever having been transferred back.
