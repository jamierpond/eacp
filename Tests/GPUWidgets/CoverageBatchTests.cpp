// Many paths in one dispatch, against the same paths one dispatch each.
//
// Every other test of this rasterizer is a batch of one, which is exactly the
// case a batch cannot get wrong: with one path every base is zero, the search
// for which path a thread belongs to has one answer, and the record it reads is
// the first. So none of them can fail on a wrong base, a search off by one, or a
// field of the record read out of the neighbouring one - and those are the whole
// of what batching added.
//
// The reference here is therefore the unbatched rasterization of the same path,
// which PathRasterizerTests has already held to the segment-by-segment CPU
// definition. What is checked is that gathering paths together does not move
// any of them.
//
// The failures worth ruling out are all silent and all specific:
//
//  - a base off by a path: one path draws another's outline
//  - the fill rule read from a neighbouring record: a star fills its own hole
//  - the origin dropped: every mask lands on top of the first
//  - the block search off by one: a strip along one path's edge belongs to the
//    path before it
//
// So the batches below are deliberately mixed: different sizes, both fill rules,
// and origins that are not multiples of the block.
