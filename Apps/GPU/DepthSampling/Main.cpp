// A pass reading the depth an earlier pass wrote, and the effect that is the
// whole reason to want it: soft particles.
//
// A translucent quad drawn into a scene is a flat sheet, and where it passes
// through the floor it says so - the floor cuts it along a perfectly straight
// line, which is the one thing a puff of steam never does. The fix is not more
// geometry. It is for the fragment to *ask how far away the floor is*: compare
// its own distance from the camera against the distance the depth buffer
// recorded there, and fade out as the two converge. The sheet then dissolves
// into whatever it meets instead of being sliced by it. It is what Doom 3's
// soft particles do, and porting them is what this eacp feature was built for.
//
// What the fragment has to read is the depth buffer of a pass that has already
// finished, which is three things put together:
//
//   TextureDescriptor::sampleableDepth   a render target whose depth plane may
//                                        be sampled and not only attached
//   DepthAction::Keep                    that pass keeping what it wrote, so
//                                        there is still something to sample
//   ShaderBuilder::depthTexture          the shader slot, bound with
//                                        RenderPass::setFragmentDepthTexture -
//                                        which takes the *render target*, a
//                                        depth attachment having no separate
//                                        existence - and whose sample() gives
//                                        back one float rather than four
//
// The order is the rule and not a suggestion: a texture cannot be sampled by
// the pass rendering into it, and the depth plane is a texture. So the scene
// goes into an off-screen target first, that pass ends, and everything after it
// reads what it left.
//
// Four panels, one scene, one camera, so the mechanism is visible rather than
// described:
//
//   colour           the off-screen target's colour plane, drawn straight out
//   depth            its *depth* plane, sampled through depthTexture() and
//                    linearised against the same near/far the scene is drawn
//                    with (0.5 and 20 units) - near is black, the far plane is
//                    white
//   hard particles   six camera-facing puffs over the scene, depth-tested and
//                    nothing more: each one is cut off along a straight line
//                    where it enters the floor
//   soft particles   the same six, fading over 0.4 units as their own distance
//                    approaches the distance the depth buffer holds. The panel
//                    this app exists for.
//
// Every panel is exactly the off-screen target's width, and every panel uses the
// same projection it was rendered with, so a fragment's own clip position names
// the texel of that target it is standing on. That is what makes the fade a
// lookup rather than a second render.
//
// TextureFormat::R32Float rides along, and not as a footnote: it is the format a
// depth copy has to land in. A fifth pass copies the depth out into one with a
// full-screen draw, and --check reads it back and prints what the same value
// would have survived as in eight bits and in a half float. The fade distance is
// 0.4 world units and eight bits cannot express it at all - see the numbers.
//
// Run with --check to render one frame headlessly and print those numbers plus
// the two particle panels as luminance grids, which is how the soft panel is
// confirmed to differ from the hard one without anyone having to look at a
// window. It exits non-zero if it does not.
