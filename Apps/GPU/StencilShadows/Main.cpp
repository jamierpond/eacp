// Stencil shadow volumes: the algorithm the stencil buffer exists for, and the
// one a Doom-3-era renderer is built out of.
//
// A shadow is not painted here. It is *counted*. The cube's silhouette is
// extruded away from the light into a closed solid - the volume of space the
// cube hides - and that solid is rendered into the stencil buffer alone, with
// the two facings counting in opposite directions. A pixel the volume covers an
// odd number of times over is inside it, and inside it means in shadow. The
// lighting pass then draws only where the count came back to zero.
//
// Three panels, one scene, so the mechanism is visible rather than described:
//
//   no stencil       the lit pass with nothing masking it - no shadow at all
//   shadow volumes   the same, with the extruded solid drawn translucently, so
//                    what is being counted can be seen
//   stencil shadows  the volume drawn to the stencil buffer only, which is the
//                    result the algorithm is for
//
// The counting is **depth-fail** (Carmack's reverse): a volume fragment that
// *fails* the depth test - one lying at or behind the surface already drawn
// there - increments on back faces and decrements on front faces. Counting
// depth *passes* instead is a line shorter and breaks the moment the camera
// enters a shadow, which is why every engine that ships this counts failures.
//
// What eacp is asked for, and all of it is Phase 0 work:
//   GPUView::setStencil                     the attachment
//   RenderPipelineDescriptor::stencilFront  per-facing ops, in one pass over
//                            /stencilBack   the volume rather than two
//   StencilOp::Increment/DecrementWrap      so an over- and an under-count still
//                                           cancel past 255
//   CompareFunction::Equal + reference 0    the lighting pass's mask
//   RenderPass::bind(program, vertices)     four programs over two app-owned
//                                           buffers the app updates in place
//
// Run with --check to render one frame headlessly and print a luminance grid,
// which is how the shadow is confirmed to fall where it should without anyone
// having to look at a window.
