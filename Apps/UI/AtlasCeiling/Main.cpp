// What an interface looks like when it asks the coverage atlas for more than the
// atlas has.
//
// Every vector shape in a component tree is rasterized into one shared texture,
// which is what makes a path cost a quad instead of a texture bind. That texture
// grows to 4096 square and then stops, and a tree whose masks do not all fit in
// it at once loses the ones that arrive last. This is that tree: 240 tiles, each
// with a polygon in it, which at two device pixels to the point comes to some 19
// million texels against the atlas's 16.8 million.
//
// Two things are worth watching, and the footer reports both.
//
// The first is that the shapes that did not fit are *missing* rather than wrong.
// Every tile keeps its frame and its number, so an empty frame is a mask that
// was refused - and refusing is a decision, taken because the alternative is
// worse. An atlas that made room on the pass whose layout is being drawn would
// relocate the shapes already placed, and each of those would then sample texels
// that now belong to somebody else: a tile drawing another tile's polygon. That
// is why the polygons have a different number of sides each. A seven-sided tile
// showing a triangle is what the wrong answer looks like, and it is not
// something you would notice in a screenshot of circles.
//
// The second is that reaching this at all takes a tree with more in it than the
// window shows. A mask is the size of the shape on screen, so everything visible
// at once cannot come to more than the window's own area -- this window is 3.2
// million device pixels against the atlas's 16.8 million, and a window of solid
// vector art would still be a fifth of it. It is scrolled-away content, hidden
// tabs and stacked shapes that reach the ceiling, which is why this demo is a
// list forty rows long rather than a full window of vector art.
