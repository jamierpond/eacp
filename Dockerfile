# Reproduces the Linux GCC lane of .github/workflows/build.yml so CI
# failures can be debugged locally instead of round-tripping through
# GitHub. Pinned to ubuntu:24.04 (= ubuntu-latest at time of writing)
# and CMake 3.31 from Kitware's release tarball — the apt cmake on
# 24.04 is 3.28, older than the project's cmake_minimum_required and
# old enough that unity-build batching diverges from CI.
#
# Build the image:
#   docker build -t eacp-ci-linux .
#
# Reproduce the GH Actions Linux GCC lane in one shot:
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/workspace eacp-ci-linux ci-build
#
# Or drop into a shell to iterate:
#   docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/workspace eacp-ci-linux
#   # then inside:
#   ci-build              # runs configure + build + ctest like CI
#   # or step through manually with cmake/ninja

# Mirrors the apt install line in build.yml plus build-essential
# (gcc/g++/make), gdb for debugging, ca-certificates/curl/git for
# CMake FetchContent, and Mesa's lavapipe (mesa-vulkan-drivers) with the
# Vulkan loader, tools and validation layers so the Vulkan backend's tests
# run headless on a software device, as the Windows lane runs on WARP.
# The Wayland half of the graphics backend needs libwayland-client, the
# protocol XML and wayland-scanner, xkbcommon and libdecor to build, and
# Weston's headless backend gives the tests a compositor to open windows on
# (see with-weston below). The X11 half needs the xcb libraries and Xvfb,
# which is the X server with-xvfb starts. The text half needs FreeType,
# HarfBuzz and fontconfig to build, and font files to mean anything once
# built: every font
# test asks fontconfig for a family by name and self-skips when nothing
# resolves, so an image with no fonts runs the whole Text suite as a silent
# green. DejaVu is the stock family the defaults name (the -extra package
# carries the ExtraLight and Condensed faces that weight and width matching
# needs), Droid Sans Fallback is the CJK fallback a missing glyph lands on, and
# Noto Color Emoji is the one colour font in the set. CMake itself comes from
# Kitware to match the version GH Actions ships.

# Runs a command inside a headless Weston session, so a test that needs a
# compositor - a Window with a real surface, a GPUView presenting through a
# swapchain - runs on a machine with no display at all. The same script the
# CI Vulkan lane runs, copied out of the tree so it is on PATH here:
#
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/workspace eacp-ci-linux \
#       with-weston ctest --test-dir build-ci-linux --output-on-failure \

# The two X11 suites are filtered out: each prefers X11 by its own default and
# there is no X server in a Weston session, so under EACP_REQUIRE_DISPLAY=1
# their aServerIsPresentWhenRequired cases would fail rather than self-skip.
# The two steps together are what build.yml runs.
#
# EACP_HEADLESS is deliberately not set by the script: a test binary that
# wants to open windows runs with it unset (or 0), and EACP_REQUIRE_DISPLAY=1
# makes such a test fail rather than self-skip when no compositor is found.
# EACP_REQUIRE_FONTS=1 does the same for the font packages installed above.
